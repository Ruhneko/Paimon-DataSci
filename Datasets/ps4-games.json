It was created by the Polish studio CD Projekt RED, which gained international fame thanks to the bestselling The Witcher series.  The game is based on Cyberpunk 2020 - a pen-and-paper system created in 1990 by Mike Pondsmith.\nStoryline and character creator\nCyberpunk 2077 is taking place in 2077, in a fictional metropolis called Night City located on the northern Californian coast. This is a dystopian retrofuturism straight from the 1980s., where a devastated world is ruled by brutal megacorporations and the streets are a kingdom of gangs and cyberpunks - independent rebels living outside the system. Moreover, thanks to technological progress, people can benefit from special implants and body modifications that increase their psychophysical abilities. We play the role of V, a rookie mercenary fighting for survival in a brutal reality.  One day, fulfilling one of the orders, the hero/heroine comes into possession of a chip hiding the secret of immortality, which is the object of desire of the most influential powers of the cyberpunk world. We create the protagonist from scratch, deciding, for example, on gender (interestingly, you can freely combine female and male characteristics), appearance, or character's origin (we have three life paths at our disposal - nomad, punk or corp - which decide, for example, where we will start the game and offer additional dialogue options).  In the character creator we also set the initial level of five basic attributes: physique, reflexes, technical ability, intelligence and composure. \nJohnny Silverhand\nA key role in the plot of Cyberpunk 2077 is played by Johny Silverhand - a feisty rockerboy (in the world of CP2020 this term is used to describe a rockman known for his contacts with the criminal underworld), who died in mysterious circumstances in the 1920s,  many years before the action of the game.  The consciousness of this character was digitised and recorded on a chip, which V comes into possession of. The fate of the uncompromising star is thus linked to the protagonist, but this does not necessarily mean that he is his ally - he may, for example, try to take over V's body against his will.\nVoice cast\nJohnny Silverhand is played by Keanu Reeves, the star known for the Matrix series and John Wick, among others.  In addition to him, the voices were lent by Gavin Drei (V male), Cherami Leigh (V female), Lovensky Jean-Baptiste (Placide), Samuel Barnett (SI Delamaina), Michael-Leon Wooley (Dester \"Dex\" DeShawn) and Jason Hightower (Jackie Welles).\nGameplay\nCyberpunk 2077 is an RPG game in which we observe the action from a first person perspective. The player explores a vast, open world (we can walk or ride cars and motorbikes) and performs various tasks, often of non-linear structure. The game also includes an interesting Braindance game mechanics, which  allows you to recreate and explore the memories of other people.  This solution is often used in many investigations.\nIn the course of the game we often have to fight as well - the combat system refers to FPS, although we also have RPG elements (as in the Destiny cycle - e.g. headshots do not necessarily kill enemies immediately, and the amount of damage inflicted is determined by the hero's statistics). We use an arsenal of diverse futuristic weapons (both fire and cold weapons), as well as additional skills and tools (e.g. we can hack safety systems and chips located in the opponents bodies). We also have the option of quietly eliminating enemies and negotiating with NPCs in order to convince them that they are right or to find a compromise.\nIn  exchange for undertaken activities we gain two types of points - apart  from standard experience used to develop skills there is street cred   indicator.  Access to ever better sellers and customers depends on it. In addition, we increase the capabilities of the hero by installing various implants. The development system is classless - we can freely mix specialisations and acquire different skills.\nNight City is divided into six districts: City Center (where the headquarters of the mega-corporations are located), Westbrook (inhabited by the rich), Pacifica (controlled by gangs), Heywood (hosting the Latinos), Watson (where immigrants found their new home) and Santo Domingo (supplying the metropolis with energy). We also have the opportunity to explore the desert areas  surrounding the city known as Badlands. \nCyberpunk 2077 is based on the  RED Engine graphic engine, which has undergone numerous improvements in  comparison to the version used in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.  The technology allowed the authors to create a detailed world with a 24-hour cycle and high traffic intensity on the streets. The PC  version also supports ray tracing and DLSS 2.0.  It is also worth noting the rich, multi-genre soundtrack, recorded by many famous performers (among others Refused band, which took on the role of the cyberpunk group Samurai).\nMultiplayer\nThe core of the  Cyberpunk gameplay is the story campaign, but CD Projekt RED's game will  also receive an extensive multiplayer mode. It will appear after the game premiere. Sadly, the developers have not yet given any details about this game mode.", "Expected_Rating": "7.8", "Current_Rating": "3.6"}, {"Title": "Horizon: Zero Dawn", "Tags": ["Action", "TPP", "science fiction", "Post Apocalypse", "sandbox", "RPG elements", "action adventure", "action RPG", "Find Your Next Game"], "Developer": "Guerrilla Games", "Publisher": "Sony Interactive Entertainment", "Mode": "single player", "Release_Date_Day": "28", "Release_Date_Month": "February", "Release_Date_Year": "2017", "Game_Description": "Horizon: Zero Dawn is a PlayStation 4 exclusive from Guerilla Games, the studio mainly known for the Killzone shooter series.

Although at the beginning the cycle represented the action games genre, over time it evolved into action RPGs; this is also the case here. The game was developed by fifteen development teams belonging to Ubisoft, under the leadership of Ubisoft Montreal.\n\nEivor\nAssassin's Creed: Valhalla is taking place in the Northern Europe in the 9th century. We play the role of a figure named Eivor who is the head of the Viking clan; interestingly, we can not only choose a female or male version of the protagonist, but also allow the animus to switch between these versions at specific moments (and this is also canonical). After leaving conflicted Norway and crossing the North Sea, the hero and his men arrive at the coast of England. Unfortunately, there is a violent fight for power in this resourceful land, and the Eivor clan attracts the attention of Alfred the Great of Wessex, who not only recognises himself as the rightful ruler of England, but also condemns the pagan vikings. To make England their new home, and to secure a place in the Valhalla, Eivor and his warriors must fight. Their future depends on the alliances we form or the dialogue options we choose.\nGameplay\nAssassin's Creed: Valhalla starts with the decision about Eivor appearance - we can modify the hairstyle, tattoos, war paint and accessories. During the game we observe the action from the third person perspective (TPP). The game is driven by feature missions (divided into chapters lasting 2-3 hours) and numerous quests and side activities. Our decisions often have an impact on the future of Eivor and his (her) clan. We are also raiding resource-rich areas, not only increasing our sphere of influence, but also obtaining the resources needed to expand our settlement.The combat system known from the previous parts of the series has been improved to reflect the brutality of the Vikings, including greater emphasis on using two weapons simultaneously. Besides, enemies can be eliminated quietly by making use of a hidden blade. We are increasing the combat potential of the Eivor by, among other things, upgrading weapons and armour with runes.\nMap\nThe open world of Valhalla consists of Norway (we leave it in the first phase of the game, but you can return to it at any time), England and some additional territories. In England we will find both the large cities of London, Winchester and J\u00c3\u00b3rv\u00c3\u00adk (York), as well as a number of smaller settlements and numerous characteristic places and buildings, headed by the Hadrian's Wall and Stonehenge. Walking is made more attractive by the parkour system, which is a showcase of the series. Navigation is based on the mechanics known from Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag and Assassin's Creed: Odyssey, which was adapted to the specificity of the time and place of action.\nIn AC: Valhalla hero' ship is a drakkar, a boat used by the Vikings for sea and river navigation. The whole crew can be on board, helping the protagonist in the game. An important change from AC: Odyssey is that the Eivor's ship can be called anywhere, standing by the water, not just in designated ports. Like earlier parts of the series, Assassin's Creed: Valhalla boasts an excellent graphic design and atmospheric soundtrack reflecting the spirit of the era.\nMultiplayer\nAssassin's Creed: Valhalla does not include multiplayer modes.

The prequel described herein wad published by Rockstar Games (known mostly for creating series such as Grand Theft Auto, Midnight Club, and Manhunt, as well as such controversial titles as Bully and Max Payne 3). Red Dead Redemption II was first released on PS4 and XONE.PlotThe action of Red Dead Redemption II is set in 1899, that is before the events depicted in Red Dead Redemption. The gang of outlaws led by Dutch van der Linde (known from Red Dead Revolver) is roaming the old West together with Linde's right hand \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Arthur Morgan, the main protagonist of this story and of the original Red Dead Redemption.

The game gives us at our disposal a vast, open world consisting of mountainous areas, streamy valleys, picturesque prairies, dense forests, and also cities inhabited by people leading their own lives according to individual agendas. The aforementioned camp is your base of operations \u00e2\u0080\u0093 during the game, you need to take care of the supplies and people's morale. What is worth remembering, this duty does not fall to Morgan exclusively \u00e2\u0080\u0093 his friends also set out for scavenging and hunting missions should the camp run scarce of a given resource (depending on that person's role, it can be wood, food, money, etc.).\nThe developers put a lot of their effort into making the in-game world realistic and living, thus the characters in it are dynamic and respond to players' actions. When traversing the wastelands, players are bound to encounter animal wildlife (rodents, birds, and predators such as bears). One can travel on foot or on a back of one of the horses that come in different breeds \u00e2\u0080\u0093 they are diversified in terms of their attitudes and the way they cope with different types of terrain like wastelands and rivers. What is important, Morgan can establish a bond with his horse \u00e2\u0080\u0093 should he earn the horse's trust, the animal can remain calm during shootouts or when encountering an aggressive animal.\nOn his adventure, Arthur has his hat full with all the quests he can complete \u00e2\u0080\u0093 from main story missions to side missions and random events. Interestingly enough, access to many of these depends on a number of variables, such as the main protagonist's reputation or the time of the day. Also important are bank robberies players must carefully prepare to. There is also nothing standing in players' way to go off hunting and sell the animal hide to one of the vendors or craftsmen. Remember though to make haste, as animal carcasses tend to rot quickly, rendering them useless.\nAs one might easily guess, Morgan is not unarmed. He has at his disposal mostly revolvers and shotguns, however, he can also shoot bows that prove useful when hunting, as an arrow does not damage the prey as bullets do.

The discovery of ancient technology developed by the extinct Protean race has enabled mankind to make its dream of interstellar flight come true and, as a result, to find its place in the Citadel, a giant space station serving as a centre of politics, trade and culture for the entire Milky Way.The main character of the series is Commander Shepard. As the first human Spectre, the defender of peace, the hero (or heroine, because we can choose the sex of the character being led) has to crush the plans of Saren, who not only betrayed the Council sitting in the Citadel, but also brought a threat to the whole galaxy. However, it soon turns out that the Saren is only a pawn, and the real deadly danger to the races inhabiting the Milky Way is the Harvesters, an ancient race of machines that cyclically sterilise the galaxy from organic life. In the second part of the cycle, Shepard enters into an alliance with Cerberus to solve the mystery of the disappearance of entire human colonies on the outskirts of the Milky Way, and hits the trail of a race of Collectors trying to speed up the approaching invasion. We can observe the invasion in the third part of the series, where in order to win (or at least try), Shepard has to gain as many allies as possible. All this in order to join them in the final battle, in which the survival of the living beings inhabiting the Milky Way is at stake.MechanicsIn the games included in the Mass Effect Trilogy: Legendary Edition set, the action is observed from the third person perspective (TPP). The driving force behind these games are extensive tasks pushing the plot forward, accompanied by numerous side missions. Commander Shepard is not left to cross the river alone because, as he progresses, he is joined by more and more comrades with whom he can establish a close relationship over time. Our command centre is Normandy, which is a futuristic spacecraft that we travel with, choosing destinations on the galaxy map. Besides, it is a kind of mobile base where we can move around freely during breaks. Although in the second and third part of the series on the planets we only travel on foot, in the first part of the cycle we also get a four-wheeled M35 Mako, which allows us to quickly explore vast areas of land.\nAn important element of the games forming this compilation is also the fight against enemies The battles take place in real time, and during them we must not only skilfully use the available weapons (in the arsenal we will find mainly firearms, including futuristic weapons developed by alien races), but also make use of various combat abilities (leading with telekinesis-like biotic skills) and give orders to subordinates (although Shepard's team is much larger, we can only take two companions on missions). By eliminating adversaries and completing tasks, we receive experience points and advance to the next levels, gradually developing the hero and his accompanying characters. \nIt is worth remembering that fighting is not the only thing the Spectre does. Many problems can be solved not by force, but by conversation; therefore, from time to time, it is not combat skills that prove very useful, but speech skills.

The player assumes the role of a young blacksmith and explores the rich, open world of the Middle Ages. Kingdom Come: Deliverance was developed by the independent Warhorse Studios which employs the creators of Mafia, among others. As far as gameplay and open world are concerned, the developers drew inspiration from games such as Skyrim and Mount & Blade. The challenging combat system was modeled after Dark Souls, while the storytelling style was borrowed from The Witcher, among others.\nStory\nThe action of Kingdom Come: Deliverance starts in 1403, several dozen years before the bloody Hussite Wars that shook not only the Kingdom of Bohemia and the Holy Roman Empire, but also other countries, including the Kingdom of Poland ruled by Wladyslaw Jagiello. The developers made sure to ensure accuracy not only in terms of details such us character appearance, but also of historical events. In the game we can meet, for example, both Polish knights, who visited Bohemia, and representatives of the Teutonic Order that competed and warred with Poland in that period.\nGameplay\nKingdom Come: Deliverance offers a lot of freedom and a huge open world. The protagonist, a humble blacksmith whose family was murdered by an invading army, is described by a number of various statistics and skills. It is entirely up to the player whether he becomes a knight or a rogue. The trait values increase with time and can also be modified by means of alchemy.

The player can move in any direction and launch precise attacks aimed at various points of an opponent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body. We can also carry out special attacks and combine strikes into combos. It is also noteworthy that the entire system is based on realistic physics, therefore every sword movement causes natural reaction of physical objects with which it interacts (so we can, for instance, bounce off an enemy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sword in a desired direction). The game\u00e2\u0080\u0099s realism is further emphasized by the fact that the food spoils and a character can wear up to four layers of clothes and armor.\nWhile designing the main story and side quests, the developers focused on quality rather than quantity. The fruit of their labor is a significant freedom of approach, e.g. a task can be accomplished without resorting to violence or with a well-placed bribe. Dialogues also play a major role in the story. During conversations, we have limited time to choose one of the available options and these decisions impact the way non-player characters view our hero.\nFrom among many gameplay elements particularly noteworthy is the crafting system, based on mini-games. It allows for the creation of new equipment as well as potions and alchemical ointments. Throughout the game we will also witness grand battles and spectacular sieges.\nTechnical aspects\nKingdom Come: Deliverance on PC, PS4 and XONE is powered by a modified version of CryEngine 3, thanks to which the game boasts effective graphics and high-quality details.

What makes things more complicated is the fact that Atreus gradually discovers his father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s past and his loyalty towards him diminishes.MechanicsGod of War introduces previously unseen gameplay mechanics and it slightly changes them and the speed of the game. This can be seen in the change of the camera\u00e2\u0080\u0099s position \u00e2\u0080\u0093 now it is constantly following the back of the protagonist like in modern action-adventure games. The style of the narration\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and tone of the story has been changed as well. Kratos abandons his favorite weapon \u00e2\u0080\u0093 double blades with chains \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and instead, he uses an axe that returns to him whenever he throws it. The weapon can be upgraded with magic runes. They enable the player to increase damage from elements like ice or fire to which some enemies are vulnerable.\nDuring the adventure, the players travel through vast levels that hide many secrets, corridors and optional encounters with enemies. The game once again features spectacular battles with bosses \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a characteristic trait of the whole series. Instead of multi-phase battles based on quick time events (where the player must press buttons displayed on the screen), now the players have full control over Kratos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 movement. Above the head of the boss, there are two bars \u00e2\u0080\u0093 one of them informs the players about his health bar and the other represents how stunned he is.\nAtreus helps in combat as well. The players can give him orders with a separate button. He can, for example, help the protagonist by shooting arrows. Similarly to his father, the boy gains experience, new skills and attacks.Technical aspectsThe developers of God of War took advantage of the power of the console in order to provide spectacular action and the level of graphics that was inaccessible for the previous entries in the series. The game features additional visual gimmicks and graphics options for owners of PlayStation 4 Pro. Once again the players can experience inventive ideas and impressive cutscenes and multi-leveled boss battles. The soundtrack was composed by Bear McCreary, an American composer who created music for awarded TV series like Battlestar Galactica, Eureka, Marvel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D, The Walking Dead and Outlander.", "Expected_Rating": "9.2", "Current_Rating": "9.02"}, {"Title": "Ghost of Tsushima", "Tags": ["Action", "TPP", "Stealth", "sandbox", "historical", "Japan", "Samurai", "action adventure", "PlayStation exclusive titles", "Find Your Next Game"], "Developer": "Sucker Punch Productions", "Publisher": "Sony Interactive Entertainment", "Mode": "single player", "Release_Date_Day": "17", "Release_Date_Month": "July", "Release_Date_Year": "2020", "Game_Description": "Ghost of Tsushima is a PlayStation 4 exclusive game.\n It was developed by the American studio Sucker Punch Productions, the creators of InFamous series and Sly Cooper series.\n Their newest project was kept in secret for three and a half years.\n It was presented for the first time during the Paris Games Week 2017.\n\n\n\nPlot\n\nThe year is 1274.\n The Mongol Empire rules over the whole Asian continent.\n Its rulers are hungry of the riches of the Feudal Japan.\n The Khan decides to start an invasion.\n Its first target is the island Tsushima, located in the middle of the Korean Strait.\n During the attack, Mongolian troops massacred most of the samurai living on the island. The hero of the game, Jin Sakai, miraculously manages to survive a tragic battle. From that point on, the protagonist's main objective is to stop the Mongols. However, to do so, he will have to forget about samurai traditions.\nGameplay\nLike productions under inFamous brand, Ghost of Tsushima is a third-person action game with an open world that can be travelled both on foot and on horseback.\n The developers focused on the stealth system.\n The enemy forces are overwhelming, so direct confrontation with adversaries is not always the most sensible idea. It is worth noting that in sneaking around, it is not only cleverness that counts. There are plenty of gadgets at the player's disposal, both to distract enemies (eg. smoke bombs, bells or firecrackers) as well as their direct elimination (bombs, throwing knives as well as burning and explosive shots).\nApart from sneaking around, we can also fight directly - using a catana or a bow. The system resembles a bit what we know, for example, from The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - the sense of speed during pairing and dodging is very important here. The player has four different combat styles at his disposal - each of them works best against a different type of enemy (the list of enemy types is quite extensive, but they can be roughly divided into several variants (e.g. swordsmen, archers, spearsmen or shield bearers).\nAlso noteworthy is the provocation system - it allows you to start the battle by throwing a challenge and then eliminate from one to several enemies with single, effective strikes (provided you manage to inflict them at the right time - failure means losing a large part of your life bar).\nIn Ghost of Tsushima, the developers resigned from the classic system of markers leading the player to the mission.\n Instead, this function is performed by elements of the environment - traces, smoke on the horizon, characteristic navigation points, and even animals. We can also use the  Guiding Wind - we set the target on the map and since then the wind blows in its direction. All these tricks and ideas are to encourage players to explore the world more closely.\nNew Game \nOn 16 October 2020 the authors made available an update 1.1. It introduced a New Game mode to Ghost of Tsushima, thanks to which players can start their adventure again with an already developed character. For its needs, previously unavailable equipment and armor, as well as a special amulet to tame dogs, have been prepared, which then actively support us in combat.\nMultiplayer\nThe core of the Ghost of Tsushima game is an extensive story campaign. In October 2020, a free DLC called Ghost of Tsushima: Legends was released, offering challenges for up to 4 players in online mode.\nTechnology\nGhost of Tsushima takes place on the Tsushima island, which is completely open for exploration.\n The surroundings are very diverse and they include bamboo forests, small islands and temples.\n The developers made sure that the locations are very climatic - we have a lot of picturesque landscapes and various details associated with feudal Japan (rice fields, cherry tree flakes). The game world has a lot of depth and is one of the main heroes of history.\nInterestingly, the game offers the opportunity to play with Japanese dubbing.", "Expected_Rating": "6.3", "Current_Rating": "8.7"}, {"Title": "The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt", "Tags": ["RPG", "TPP", "fantasy", "books", "sandbox", "Polish", "action RPG"], "Developer": "CD Projekt RED", "Publisher": "CD Projekt RED", "Mode": "single player", "Release_Date_Day": "19", "Release_Date_Month": "May", "Release_Date_Year": "2015", "Game_Description": "The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt for PC, PS4 and XONE is the third installment in the popular series of role-playing games based on the prose of Andrzej Sapkowski. The game was developed by CD Projekt RED which also produced the two previous games.The players assume the role of the witcher known from the previous games. The main part of the storyline revolves around several separate threads such as the search of Geralt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lost love and Nilfgaard invasion of the Northern Kingdoms. The players are also going to fight the eponymous Wild Hunt which haunted the wither both in novels and the two previous games. All of these main tasks offer a branched film-quality story, impressive scenes, and carefully directed cutscenes. Interestingly enough, the players can give up some of these tasks, however, they will have to face the unpleasant consequences of their choice. There are lots of side quests available in the game which together with the main plot offer over one hundred hours of gameplay. The developers took their time to provide a large variety of challenges. During the adventure, the players will explore a wide range of areas, including caves, ancient ruins, and bustling villages. They will also hunt monsters for profit and for special rewards, while some of the quests will include investigation. Each region of the world offers its own mini-games (e.g. knife-throwing tournament) with special prizes, however, beating them is not required for the plot to progress.\nAccording to tradition of the series, the third Witcher game offers a great amount of freedom to play as the players see fit. The story line is significantly branched so as to allow the players to make different choices. At the same time, the virtual world is highly dynamic. For example, some of the player\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions can make a village threatened by bandit attacks completely depopulated. The world of the game is one of open structure which is forty times bigger than the one of The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings. The new game engine, REDengine 3, is designed to load data in the background in order to avoid loading screens. Travelling is now easier thanks to the possibility of horseback riding. With a good steed going from one end of the map to the other takes about 30-40 minutes. The players can also fast-travel to places they have already visited.\nConsiderable changes were introduced to the combat system. The artificial intelligence of the opponents was completely rebuilt. Geralt now has 96 combat animations while in the previous game he had only 20 of them. The players can finally stop the attack in the middle of it and block and dodge blows even when they run out of stamina, although it limits its effectiveness. Additionally, they can perform fast pirouettes instead of the flips to evade the attack. The new camera system provides a clear perspective during combat. There will be a plenty of boss-fights, with an ice giant among other, but they will not be scripted this time. The sign system is also redesigned. Each of the five signs has a basic level, as the leveling up progresses, Geralt gains access to the the second level of a sign. For example, improved Igni triggers an explosion of fire that surrounds the protagonist. Level-two Yrden, in turn, creates a field of energy which slows down all opponents within its range rather than just trap one of them.\nDuring combat, the PC, PS4 and XONE users can use the surrounding environment to a great extent. For example, it is possible to telekinetically hit a wasps\u00e2\u0080\u0099 nest which will attack Geralt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enemies. When they turn on him, he can burn them with Igni. Expanding the knowledge of opponents allows the player to discover their weaknesses. Some of defeated monsters will be a source of components which are impossible to obtain in any other way and can be used to craft items or to brew potions. They will also enable Geralt to mutate which gives him access to new abilities. The players can also develop fencing and alchemy skills.", "Expected_Rating": "9.1", "Current_Rating": "8.705"}, {"Title": "Outriders", "Tags": ["Action", "TPP", "science fiction", "RPG elements", "Polish", "TPS", "cross-platform", "co-op", "shooters", "Role-playing shooter", "Find Your Next Game"], "Developer": "People Can Fly", "Publisher": "Square-Enix / Eidos", "Mode": "single / multiplayer", "Release_Date_Day": "01", "Release_Date_Month": "April", "Release_Date_Year": "2021", "Game_Description": "Outriders is a third-person shooter set in a dark, science-fiction universe, enriched with pronounced RPG elements. The production was developed by Polish studio People Can Fly, whose portfolio includes such games as Painkiller, Bulletstorm and Gears of War: Judgment. It's released by Square Enix.Plot\nOutriders is set in the distant future, with Earth destroyed, and humanity's only hope for survival being a distant planet Enoch.  A huge spaceship called Flores is sent to the planet, where the eponymous Outriders, perfectly trained soldiers, have to deal with potential threats of the new world. Although initially, the planet Enoch seemed an exceptionally hospitable place, the colonizers picked up a strange signal after some time; when they tried to reach its source, a powerful Anomaly was triggered. The cataclysm killed many settlers and severely injured others, while destroying nearly all the technology taken from Earth. Among the survivors was the protagonist, whom we play as during the game. In an effort to keep him alive, however, the others were forced to put him into a long coma.The protagonist awakens after more than thirty years and quickly discovers that Enoch has turned into a barren wasteland where colonists must fight for survival every day. As if that weren't enough, the Anomaly has given many people supernatural abilities, which they use to their advantage. Fortunately, our prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9 has also gained formidable powers, which help to investigate the source of the mysterious signal and stand up to fight for a better tomorrow for the people.ClassesBefore starting the Outriders adventure , we choose one of four character classes. These include, among others, a pyromancer, who sets fire to everything that comes his way, a nimble trickster who can manipulate time, and a heavy-armed devastator who feels best on the front line. The game proper starts right there. The authors have prepared a number of locations, among which the most important role is played by expanded hubs. There, we can talk to the settlers and accept tasks from them (both pushing forward the plot and side quests), as well as learn more about the presented world.\nThe foundation of the game is completing the missions and fighting with hordes of enemies, on our way there will monsters of all sorts and hostile people. Clashes are dynamic and although the game implements a system of cover, aggressive behavior is often more rewarding. One of the things that encourages you to be more offensive it is the system of regenerating life points \u00e2\u0080\u0093 while a small part of them can be restored by avoiding enemy fire, more can be regained in other ways, determined by your character's profession; for example, a pyromancer heals as setting fire to enemies, while a devastator heals as they manage to kill an enemy in melee combat. During battles we use an extensive arsenal of firearms and a wide range of combat skills. For example, the trickster can teleport across the battlefield and create \"bubbles\" that slow down opponents, while the pyromancer creates a devastating wall of fire.\nThe character development system is also included. During the gameplay we receive experience points and gain further levels. Every few promotions, we unlock new abilities, but although each class has eight of them, only three can be active at the same time. However, we receive so-called class points on subsequent levels, which we can spend on special modifications that provide us with additional buffs in the form of bonuses to hero stats or specific skills. We also increase our combat potential by collecting better equipment and by modifying our weapons and armor elements.\nOutriders runs on Unreal Engine 4 technology. The developers have made good use of its capabilities, and you'll especially love the effects that accompany the use of character abilities, the detailed enemy models, and the detailed environments.Co-opOutriders can be played both alone and with up to two people in a cooperative mode. In multiplayer, the game's difficulty level is scaled to the experience level and equipment quality of the entire team.Outriders demoOn February 25, 2021, Outriders demo was released allowing players to test all four classes in the first hours of the game, either solo or in co-op.

Besides Dying Light, the studio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s portfolio includes games like Dead Island and the Call of Juarez game series.StoryThe action of Dying Light 2 takes place 15 years after the events of the original game and is set in a completely different area. The general outline of the plot is also similar and builds on the idea of a viral zombie outbreak. The sequel tells the story of a community of survivors struggling in a city infested by zombies (who become especially aggressive after nightfall).In contrast to the previous release, this time, the developers decided not to focus on a linear storyline, and instead, they placed their bet on a so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009cnarrative sandbox\u00e2\u0080\u009d style of storytelling, which enables players to build their own story through making decisions over the course of the game.

Besides letting the players decapitate enemies, the game includes a crafting system, which allows adding many different features to weapons.\nThe game places a lot of emphasis on parkour elements, which allow players to traverse the world with a lot of freedom, the only limitation here being the fact that every action (even holding onto a ledge) uses up some of the stamina bar. Dying Light 2 has twice as many animations relating to movement including jumping, running, and other stunts. The creators also included environmental puzzles based on stunts, forcing the players to plan their routes ahead.\nThe game features a day/night cycle, which has an impact on the strength and behavior of enemies; zombies become much more dangerous after sunset, thus, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good idea to keep an eye on the time and explore the surroundings carefully.

The title was developed with close cooperation with Sony Computer Entertainment.\nStory\nContrary to the previous games by the Japanese developer that took place in quasi-medieval settings, Bloodborne takes us to a 19th-century Victorian dark fantasy world. The action takes place in a depressing and grim city of Yharnam. The citizens of this unfriendly metropolis are struck with a mysterious plague that transforms people into crazed and terrifying beats. The city is full of hidden paths, shortcuts, and blind alleys that may turn out to be a grave danger. In the game, the players will discover mysteries of Yharnam, trying to find out who or what is responsible for the plague.\nGameplay\nThe gameplay of Bloodborne will seem familiar to all fans of the Souls series. The game is a third-person action RPG with a challenging combat system and high overall difficulty level. The decision to take the action to a large city, and the 19th-century setting opened completely new possibilities before the developers and allowed them to introduce innovative solutions into the gameplay mechanics.Starting out, we create our character from scratch. The hero has two kinds of weapons, each held in one hand, at their disposal. In the left hand, we hold firearms - their significant firepower is balanced by a long reload time. In the right hand, we wield a melee weapon such as a huge cleaver resembling a saw that can be used in various ways. Since the protagonist does not have a shield, our primary defenses are parries, dodges, and quick counterattacks.\nTechnical aspects\nBloodborne is powered by a new engine adapted to work under PS4.

The Sims quickly surpassed in popularity the  other games from the developer's catalogue, becoming a phenomenon and  one of the most popular brands in the electronic entertainment industry.GameplayThe Sims 4 doesn't introduce any revolutionary changes in gameplay model.  In the course of the game the player takes care of the family of virtual  Sims, taking care of all their spiritual and material needs, as well as  providing a place to live, designing a house and a garden. \nThe entire  game begins with the creation of your Sims.  In The Sims 4 it was decided  to remodel the character creation system.  This time the face  modification system was extended - sliders for changing a given element  were replaced with mouse movements, at the same time increasing the  scope of changes.  The possibility to edit the entire character body was  also added.  The ability to freely customise hair and clothing colours  has been removed, returning to predefined sets.\nThe character of the Sim also plays a huge role.  Players choose a few of the dozens of personality traits available, as well as the character's long-term goals.  These affect the character's subsequent behaviour and are part of the improved artificial intelligence system introduced in the game.  Thanks to this system, Sims behave more naturally and react in a much more varied way to situations around them.  Also new are the emotions felt by the virtual heroes.  They are influenced not only by the needs currently fulfilled or not, or social interactions, but also by the household equipment used or clothes worn.  Experiencing specific emotions will unlock new dialogue options, among other things. \nAfter creating the Sims, the player has to bring them into the house.  He can leave it in the form prepared by the developers or completely redesign it. This is because the game offers an extensive tool, allowing you to build and furnish your own flats.

We'll find a dam or a sawmill here. It is worth noting that all buildings are hand-designed, making each one unique.Up to 150 people can take part in a single game simultaneously. Players are dropped on the map with a parachute (the drop point can be selected) and then try to achieve their goals depending on the chosen game mode. Equipment plays an important role - both weapons and vehicles (e.g. different kinds of cars and even helicopters) - which allow you to gain an advantage over your rivals. We can find or buy equipment in special places.\nDuring the game, players can also achieve additional goals - the contracts that have different requirements (e.g. to find packages or do reconnaissance at a specific location). By completing the task, we gain additional equipment or money for which we can buy it.Game modes\n\nIn Call of Duty: Warzone, we can only play with other players. The gameplay is based on network multiplayer mode.\nWe have two game modes at our disposal: Battle Royale and Plunder. The first game mode focuses on eliminating other players on an increasingly shrinking map (this is due to the use of lethal combat gas). We compete in three-person teams. The game ends when someone manages to eliminate all enemies. Members of one team can resurrect their comrades by spending money. After the first death we also have to deal with quite unique mechanics - we get to the gulag, in which we fight in a 1-on-1 duel for the possibility to return to the main part of the game.\nIn the second module our goal is to collect money scattered around the location and offered for contracts. We can also eliminate other players to take away their cash.Technical aspects\nCall of Duty: Warzone has a nice, three-dimensional graphic design.

The game vas developed by Kojima Productions and published by Sony.The main designer and scriptwriter is the father of Metal Gear series - Hideo Kojima, for whom it was the first game developed after leaving Konami, where he spent more than three decades of his career in the industry. The main character in Death Stranding is portayed by Norman Reedus, known for his role of Daryl Dixon in The Walking Dead TV series. The actor had previously worked with Kojima on the cancelled Silent Hills project.\nStory\nThe authors of this game presented a grotesque vision of the world in the undefined future. The plot revolves around deadly weather phenomena, especially rain, which in this world has extraordinary properties. Everything that is wetted by rain, known as Timefall, is displaced in time. This means an extreme acceleration of the aging process in all living organisms, including even plants.\nAnother important element is the presence of creatures invisible to the naked eye, which are a real threat to all inhabitants of the planet. The game's protagonist and his companions use a special futuristic device to detect the presence of these creatures and avoid confrontation.\nThe story told in the game largely focuses on showing the relationship between life and death. The title itself refers to a disturbing phenomenon that we know from the real world, i.e. the unexpected appearance of cetaceans on the banks of water reservoirs, which usually leads to their death.\nMechanics\nDuring the game, players travel through an unfriendly world, trying to avoid direct confrontations with dark, invisible monsters. The main character of the game is unique because the deadly rain does not affect him as much as other living organisms.\nThe death of a character never means the end of the game. Absorption by hostile beings puts us in a state between life and death. The very moment of confrontation with enemies leads to a powerful explosion that leaves behind a large crater. When the protagonist comes back to life from the transition state, every trace he left in the game world (including the explosion crater) still remains in the same place.\nAn important element of gameplay mechanics is also asynchronous multiplayer. With this option, players can share their stocks and hideouts.\nTechnical issues\nThe game is based on the Decima engine, which was created by specialists from Guerrilla Games studio and used, among others, in Horizon Zero Dawn.

To delay the unavoidable we are forced to carefully manage our limited resources, which need to be acquired either by exploring the vast and rich, but dangerous, underwater world or by scavenging whatever we can find on the island itself. The developers have made it extremely difficult to get to know the precise layout of the surrounding region, as the island changes with each playthrough.\nThe crafting system is one of the most important mechanics within the game. The Australian team has put a lot of effort towards making it as intuitive as possible; the visible UI has been reduced to the absolute minimum, forcing the player to work it out by himself how to combine different elements and pieces to create useful tools. Apart from the basic equipment (e.g. a fishing rod or primitive weaponry), we can also craft more advanced structures, such as a raft or a shack.\nSince Stranded Deep is a survival game, the players will face a lot of different dangers during their playthrough. Avoiding the most obvious threats among them - an encounter with a shark or heading out for the open water during a storm, which will usually end with our hero\u00e2\u0080\u0099s untimely demise - is just the beginning. It is also crucial to provide our character with an appropriate diet, as with time our food supplies will spoil and salt water only bolsters our thirst; the weather conditions, such as extreme heat during the day or bitter cold in the night, can also prove to be deadly.\nStranded Deep on PC stands apart from many other indie productions, due to its extremely colorful, high quality visuals; the developers take a great deal of pride in the day and night cycle and the dynamic weather effects, which they have single-handedly created.

After several months of waiting, an improved version of the game appeared on the market, dedicated to the fourth Sony console.Grand Theft Auto V on PlayStation 4 boasts improved graphics (better character models, new lighting, textures, more flora and fauna, etc.). The biggest news, however, is the FPP mode, which can be switched on at any time, thus changing the gameplay experience. It is also worth noting that the Rockstar Games team has put a lot of effort into the work, thanks to which, when looking at the world from the first person perspective, we enjoy many details, such as refined car interiors. Also Grand Theft Auto Online, a multiplayer mode, has been slightly changed. While the basic concept of the game consisting of visiting the huge world, taking part in various tasks, missions, races and games has not changed, the developers have increased the limit of people taking part in the game. Instead of sixteen players, thirty of them can play on PlayStation 4 simultaneously.Plot\n\nThe action of Grand Theft Auto V takes place in the great open city of Los Santos, where three unusual characters lead dangerous lives. Being in the witness protection program former robber Michael leads a peaceful life until the day he sets his wife up on treason with a tennis instructor. He angrily destroys a lover's villa, but it turns out it was owned by one of the drug barons. Michael has no choice but to go back to his old job by robbing a jewelry store. The burglary, however, draws the attention of his former partner, Trevor Philips, who finds him and encourages him to cooperate again. Both criminals are joined by a boy from the ghetto, Franklin, who wants to make a large fortune quickly.MechanicsDuring the game in Grand Theft Auto V we control all three characters - we can switch between them at any time (except for role-playing missions that impose specific roles), thus changing the place of action. The game is to do various jobs, among which robbery is the most important. Before making a given jump we have to pass a few smaller tasks, e.g. to get the necessary equipment. Then we hire helpers, choose one of the two methods and go into action. Apart from feature missions, the developers also took care of a lot of smaller jobs. However, they do not come to the background, as they often provide us with new information about the main characters.\nAll this is happening in Los Santos. It is a huge metropolis, created on the basis of over 250 thousand photos of Los Angeles and the surrounding area. The developers, however, did not limit themselves to urbanised areas where there is no shortage of skyscrapers and modern settlements. During the game we also visit suburban locations, go to the pier or dive in the ocean. We get to the various places using different vehicles. Most often we use cars, divided into different categories - passenger, racing, off-road etc. Apart from that, nothing stands in the way of flying in a helicopter, riding a bike or sitting at the helm of a bathyscaph.\nWhile doing all the missions, of course, we earn money, which we spend on shopping in local clothing and weapons stores. If we are rich enough, we can invest in one of the available properties, or make a gift of an expensive sports car. In addition, the game is varied by a number of mini-games, such as tennis, golf and bowling. Developers also allow for yoga training, hacking computers and more.Game modes\n\nGrand Theft Auto V was divided into two separate games - single and multiplayer. In the first case, we take part in the feature campaign, we travel around the city in search of finds and secrets, perform side missions, etc. The multiplayer mode, called Grand Theft Auto Online, is devoid of top-down history and allows for an unfettered, sandbox-like gameplay in which we can become a mafia boss, take part in races, robberies, a mode reminiscent of a motorcycle competition from the TRON movie and more.

In the spring of 2016, another expansion, The Witcher 3: Blood and Wine, came out. The add-on, described in detail below, brings an entirely new story starring Geralt of Rivia \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the eponymous witcher created by a Polish fantasy writer, Andrzej Sapkowski \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that takes tens of hours to complete.\nStory\nThe story of Blood and Wine takes us to the entirely new land called Touissant, one of the few countries in the Witcher universe that have not been touched by war. As it quickly turns out, the atmosphere of peace and bliss in Touissant is but an appearance. In fact, the duchy hides a dark and bloody secret, and thus, the White Wolf will have to face an evil that, once again, can be fought and defeated only by a witcher.\nGameplay\nCompared to The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, Blood and Wine for PS4 does not introduce any major changes to the gameplay mechanics, save for a number of novelties, tweaks, and enhancements brought by the subsequent patches for the original game. Just like with Hearts of Stone, the first paid DLC for The Witcher 3, the expansion offers a completely new, multi-threaded plot which is comparable in size to that of The Witcher from 2007, the first installment of The Witcher series. Moreover, the game was supplemented with multitude of side quests, new treasures to find, bandit camps to loot, new equipment and Gwent cards, as well as entirely new NPCs. Unlike Hearts of Stone, the action of Blood and Wine takes place outside of the realms known from the vanilla game. Once we install the expansion, the duchy of Touissant will appear on the map.\nAdditional information\nIn 2015, The Witcher 3: Blood and Wine received a grant of 150 thousand euros (7% of the budget, which totals to more than 2 million euros) from the Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency of the European Union. Given the fact that the first expansion for The Witcher 3 had a similar budget, it is easy to calculate that CD Projekt RED spent nearly as much money on the production and promotion of both add-ons as on the development of the first installment in The Witcher series, which cost about 20 million zlotys (around 5 million dollars).", "Expected_Rating": "8.7", "Current_Rating": "8.2"}, {"Title": "Tom Clancy's The Division 2", "Tags": ["Action", "TPP", "RPG elements", "TPS", "co-op", "MMO", "shooters", "Role-playing shooter", "Games as a service"], "Developer": "Massive Entertainment / Ubisoft Massive", "Publisher": "Ubisoft", "Mode": "single / multiplayer", "Release_Date_Day": "15", "Release_Date_Month": "March", "Release_Date_Year": "2019", "Game_Description": "Tom Clancy's The Division 2 is the second installment in the action game series with clear RPG elements that revolve around multiplayer online experience.

Unlike the previous parts of the series, which were action games, this production represents the RPG action genre. The title was created by Ubisoft's in-house studio in Montreal.\nPlot\nAssassin's Creed Odyssey begins in 431 BC with the outbreak of the conflict between Sparta and Athens, known as the Peloponnese War. Before starting the game we choose one of the two characters \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Alexios or Kassandra, grandchildren of the famous king of Sparta, Leonidas. However, they were cursed by the family and banished; we meet them when they earn a living as mercenaries as adults. The beginning of the title Odyssey, on the other hand, is the moment when the heroine or heroine takes on orders that will radically change his life, opening the way for him to become a Spartan heroine.Unlike earlier Assassin's Creed games, Odyssey's plot is to some extent non-linear. In the course of the struggle, we make decisions that influence the course and end of the script \u00e2\u0080\u0093 although we cannot influence the fate of the world, the choices we make are translated into the life of the protagonist (the creators allow us, for example, to romance with selected people) and the characters around him. The story is conveyed both in film interviews and in conversations in which the developers, for the first time in the history of the series, gave players the opportunity to choose dialogue issues.\nSeparate mention should be made of the fact that in Assassin's Creed Odyssey historical and mythical characters appear, headed by Socrates, documenting our actions by Herodotus, Hippocrates known as the father of modern medicine, or even Pericles, who fought to defend Athens' independence.\nMechanics\nIn Assassin's Creed Odyssey we observe the action from a third party perspective (TPP). The game gives us a vast open world, which consists of several regions, varying in terms of landscape, season and population density. In addition to Attica, which is central to Athens and Lakonia, where Sparta is located, there are also militarized Achaia and Messinia, forest islands with a beautiful golden autumn, or even the glamorous city of Corinth.\nWe can travel along this \"sandbox\" both on foot (which makes the parkour system, which is a showpiece of the series, allowing the heroes to overcome obstacles in a spectacular and instant way), and on the back of a mountain named Phobos. In addition, the game returns free sailing, a hallmark of Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag released in 2013. Our ship, Adrestia, can be modified by changing its appearance and equipment. Of course, we do not swim alone on the sea - during the game we can recruit the crew (also from among stunned enemies), and each of its members has unique abilities, which influence our combat potential during battles with enemy units.

Offering a high difficulty level and a turn-based combat system, the game is the fifth full-fledged installment in the Divinity series, and it constitutes a direct continuation to the well-received Divinity: Original Sin, which came out in June 2014. Similar to the predecessing game, Divinity: Original Sin II was created by Larian \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a Belgian development studio. It is also worth noticing, that the production process was partially financed through a crowd-funding campaign on Kickstarter (over 2 million dollars were gathered).PlotThe player is again taken to a fantasy world known as Rivellon, though the story is set about a thousand years after the events depicted in Divinity: Original Sin (right after Beyond Divinity). However, this time the player assumes the role of a character that uses the power of the Source \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in contrast to that, the predecessing game placed the player in control of two hunters that were after the adepts of this forbidden magic. The conflict between the two groups continues on, and the player-controlled character is on the run from the representatives of the Order trying to track them down. Simultaneously, the protagonist struggles to put an end to the crisis caused by the invasion of monsters from the Void (this resulted from the death of the Divine). This entire layout also brings an atmosphere that is different to that offered by the first Original Sin, as it is visibly heavier and more serious here.MechanicsThis time around, the player begins with creating one, central character that represents one of several available races. Another important novelty in the character creation process is constituted by assigning a biographic background to one's avatar. Depending on the protagonist's background (also, they can be male or female), the inhabitants of the game world react to their presence in various ways and can even give them different quests. As a result, the role-playing layer of the game is more profound than in the predecessing game, and problems placed in front of the protagonist can be solved in more ways.Divinity: Original Sin II for PC, PS4 and XONE extends the mechanics developed in the previous installments. The largest changes were introduced into the combat system, as an ability to climb platforms or towers was added, and the influence of heights on characters' fighting abilities was taken into account. Action points are calculated here in a slightly simplified way, and performing most actions costs 1-3 points. Furthermore, the creators included new skills and element combinations \u00e2\u0080\u0093 making a good use of these can tip the balance in favour of the player's victory in combat. The powers of the Source constitute another novelty; although the player is required to refill the special Source points in order to use those powers, they gain access to exceptionally powerful and dangerous abilities in so doing.Game modesAs previously, the adventure can be experienced in the co-op mode, this time for up to 4 players. Interestingly however, cooperation can easily turn into rivalry, as because of different backgrounds, characters can have contradictory goals to be achieved in the same situations.\nApart from that, Larian Studios included a separate, PvP mode, which places groups of four players against one another on arenas designed with creativity. The participants take on the roles of pre-defined characters and compete against one another in different variations of such classic modes as Free-for-All, Capture the Flag or King of the Hill.Technical aspectsDivinity: Original Sin II for PC, PS4 and XONE utilizes an enhanced version of the engine used in production of Divinity: Original Sin, that is, the Divinity Engine 3.0.

All versions of the game offer a multiplayer mode for up to six players.MechanicsDark Souls: Remastered is an action RPG set in a dark fantasy world inspired by multiple themes such as knights, kings, death, dungeons, fire, and chaos. Unlike the previous game created by From Software, in Dark Souls the world is not divided into separate levels. Instead, players can freely travel between different areas and reach any spot they see on their screen. This way the developers have increased the importance of exploration and designed more complex locations (both horizontally and vertically wise). During the game, players once again get to traverse dark castle corridors and abandoned dungeons with no detailed maps at their disposal.In Dark Souls: Remastered, players can experience mechanics very similar to those featured in Demon's Souls. One starts the game from creating his or her own character \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can choose the character's sex, appearance, name, and class. The last element is not binding, as you can develop your character in any way you see fit with no restrictions.\nDuring the game, players are bound to use multiple weapons. Each one grants the main protagonist unique attacks and character animations; nonetheless, players need to remember that all this depends on the main protagonist's proficiency with a given weapon and whether they decide to wield it in one or both hands. Developers have also improved the physics engine, which allows you to gain a tactical advantage over different enemies. Moreover, the protagonist wields magic (spells and miracles). In order to purchase new equipment and earn experience, players need to gather souls from the eliminated foes.Game modesThe multiplayer mode plays a major role in Dark Souls: Remastered for PC, PS4 and etc. \u00e2\u0080\u0093 players can cooperate after summoning each other to get help, compete against one another, and watch other players' deaths in the form of messages they leave behind after falling in battle.

One of the latter ones is with no doubt Assassin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Creed \u00e2\u0080\u0093 developed since 2007, which with each installment has taken players to the far corners of the globe, including the Holy Land from the time of the Crusades, Renaissance Italy, Paris during the Great Revolution, and the 19th century London. Assassin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Creed Origins available (among other platforms) on PlayStation 4 takes us to the Ancient Egypt, where we can experience the beginnings of the Assassin Brotherhood. Players assume the role of one of its founders \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Bayek. This game is a form of a new beginning for the series, as it offers a larger world with a number of novelties in terms of the gameplay mechanics.PlotThe action of Assassin's Creed Origins is set in Ancient Egypt, where the brotherhood of the titular Assassins has originated from. Players assume the role of Bayek from Siwa and learn about the intrigue standing behind the creation of the Assassin organization. The main protagonist of this story is one of the Nubian warriors, who for centuries have served the pharaohs as agents and elite lawmen. Bayek along with his fellow soldiers have become obsolescent when the Greek influences were spread by the Ptolemaic dynasty - in face of these changes, the main protagonist is left with no other choice than to adapt to the new situation.Similarly to most of the previous installments in the series, apart from the historical part of the plot, there are also the elements taking place at the present times. Players get to uncover more secrets of the Abstergo Industries, which is only a cover for the organization fighting the Assassins - the Templars.MechanicsAssassin's Creed Origins for PS4 gives at players' disposal an open world that in terms of its size matches the one featured in Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag. The in-game world comprises cities (such as Giza, in which you can see both Pyramids and the Sphinx), oasis (such as Fajum and Siwa), and the Nile Delta. This time around, the map is not divided into sectors loaded during the game; this also regards the underwater bottom, where players can discover ruins and ship wreckages. An important aspect of the game is the exploration players can perform both afoot (once again, we can enjoy the free running system allowing us to climb the infrastructure and jumping between different constructions parkour style) and on the back of a steed - either a horse or a camel. Moreover, the game also offers the opportunity to ride a chariot and travel onboard boats.\nThe in-game world is inhabited by wild animals (Bayek can domicile them and, if necessary, use their help in combat) as well as NPCs (for the first time in the series, their life is subject to the day and night cycle and their unique duties). These neutral characters are the ones that assign story and side quests that propel the game. In comparison to the missions from the previous installments, the ones in the game described herein feature a much more open structure.\nOther changes include the combat mechanics. The developers have abandoned the formula based on spectacular counterattacks and implemented dodging, blocking the enemy blows with a shield, and using moments when enemies put their guard down. Moreover, the attacks have been divided into two categories: light attacks can be used when fighting weaker opponents, while the heavy blows are most effective against armored enemies (including bosses). Additionally, after filling the special adrenaline bar, Bayek can mount a destructive attack able to knock down even the strongest foes. The main protagonist gets at his disposal diversified weapons \u00e2\u0080\u0093 these include cold steel for close combat (axes, bats, swords, daggers, and clubs) as well as ranged weapons (several types of bows). Similarly to the previous installments, the main protagonist can perform sneak attacks with his hidden blade and use gadgets such as smoke grenades. What is worth noticing, the pieces of equipment can be upgraded thanks to the elaborate crafting system.\nThe clear RPG elements include also the character development system. On their adventure, players earn experience points and level up their characters by purchasing new skills from the character development tree. These skills are divided into three groups representing their own preferences: Master Warrior includes talents regarding close combat, Master Hunter allows players to master archery and stealth elimination of the enemies, Master Seer regards tools utilized by Bayek and his ability to manipulate the environment. Somewhat above these groups, there is also Senu, a domiciled eagle, and Bayek's faithful companion. Players can dispatch the bird for reconnaissance (allowing them to familiarize themselves with the landform and enemy locations). By developing Senu's abilities one increases the chances of spotting the enemies and distracting them.Technical aspectsAssassin's Creed Origins has been based on AnvilNext 2.0 technology - a new version of the proprietary graphics engine, which allowed the developers to significantly improve the game's visuals.

Moreover, the players can use different magical powers, for example: Wrath of El Dorado from Uncharted, Cintamani Stone from Uncharted 2 or Spirit of the Djinn from Uncharted 3, that let us, for instance, move faster.Furthermore, we can also summon helpers, such as a medic that increases our health.

The production is a spin-off (created after deletion of the third part of the cycle) and belongs to the battle royale genre, represented by titles such as Playerunknown\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Battlegrounds, Fortnite: Battle Royale czy Dying Light: Bad Blood. The game in question, however, introduces some of its own ideas to this convention. The well-known Respawn Entertainment studio is responsible for its creation, and the publisher is Electronic Arts.PlotApex Legends does not have a fully-fledged plot, but the action of the game takes place in the already existing universe of science fiction with its own history and atmosphere. Until recently, two factions warred in the universe of Titanfall \u00e2\u0080\u0093 one was the powerful consortium of corporations; the other, were the rebellious inhabitants of the planets, exploited by the corporations. The conflict ended, but with the arrival of peace, the locations, where fighting took place, were abandoned in a state of complete ruin. Their inhabitants made an attempt to build the civilization anew, and one of the manifestations of their culture became the Apex Games \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a brutal competition in which groups of daredevils fight for life and death.In Apex Legends, we play the role of participants in these clashes \u00e2\u0080\u0093 futuristic gladiators. Unlike many other battle royal games, in Apex Legends we don't control an anonymous character, but a specific hero (the title Legend) who has their own story and goals. Among the available heroes one can find Wraith, a warrior suffering from amnesia, who has the ability to manipulate space-time, or Nox, a scientist and hunter specializing in in the use of combat gases.MechanicsApex Legends is a first-person battle royale shooter. Up to 60 players can take part in the clashes, divided into 20 three-person teams. Every game starts in the same way \u00e2\u0080\u0093 from landing on the board and then searching for weapons (you will find here, among others, shotguns, rifles, snipers and machine guns). It is worth noting that the best equipment is on mobile supply ships \u00e2\u0080\u0093 landing on one of them may give us a considerable advantage over the competition.\nThe battle lasts, until more than one team fights on a gradually shrinking map. The production of the Respawn Entertainment studio enriches the formula of the battle royale with ideas known from the so-called hero shooters. All heroes controlled by players have a set of specific skills that make them extremely dangerous (or useful) in certain situations. Some abilities make it easier to move around the map, others allow you to heal companions or attack enemies. Assembling a balanced team allows us to gain tactical edge over the rest. An interesting solution are the so-called respawn beacons that remain after fallen comrades. If we collect one of them and get to a specific point on the map, we will be able to \"resurrect\" the company, allowing it to return to the battlefield.\nAs the game progresses, we receive experience points, which allow us to advance to the next player level (maximum 100). Advancing to a level also means receiving a prize \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Apex packages (they contain cosmetic items or the currency used to create them) and Legendary tokens, thanks to which you unlock new heroes.Game modes Apex Legends offers online gameplay exclusively. The game does not have a single-player campaign \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the basis of the game is the online multiplayer mode.Technical aspectsApex Legends is based on a modified Source Engine (created by Valve studio and known from Half-Life 2). Graphic design of this production presents a decent level. The models, animations, textures and lighting cannot be criticized, although in terms of technology the production of Respawn Entertainment studio without doubt cannot compete with the best-looking first-person shooters on the market. Interesting character and level design is also a big perk.\nIt is worth noting that Apex Legends was released in a free-to-play model with micropayments (in the shop inside the game, you can buy only cosmetic items).", "Expected_Rating": "4.1", "Current_Rating": null}, {"Title": "Detroit: Become Human", "Tags": ["Adventure", "TPP", "cyberpunk", "science fiction", "arcade elements"], "Developer": "Quantic Dream", "Publisher": "Sony Interactive Entertainment", "Mode": "single player", "Release_Date_Day": "25", "Release_Date_Month": "May", "Release_Date_Year": "2018", "Game_Description": "Detroit: Become Human for PS4 is another adventure game developed by French studio Quantic Dream, the creators of Fahrenheit, Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls.

At the same time, it retains some solutions that have worked in the \u00e2\u0080\u009csecond one\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and introduces a handful of novelties.\nStory\nDragon Age: Inquisition for PC, PS4 and etc. takes the player yet again to the world of Thedas which, after the events of the previous two games, has plunged into chaos. The action begins 10 years after the finale of Dragon Age: Origins. Kingdom of Ferelden did not manage to regain full strength after the fifth Blight - a large-scale invasion of Darkspawn, which was the main theme of DA: Origins - and Orlais is embroiled in a civil war. Meanwhile, mages and Templars are battling all over the continent. Amid this fuss a tear in the border between the realm of mortals and the Fade is created, leading to a demon invasion. This new threat is to be faced by the politically independent Inquisition.The players assume the role of the leader of this organization, and their mission is to discover the identity of the person responsible for bringing demons into the world of the living, and to gather enough power to stop the invasion. Character creator not only offers choosing the class (warrior, rogue, mage), gender, the appearance, and the name for the protagonist but also the race (human, elf, dwarf, and qunari). The protagonist is fully voiced.\nGameplay\nThe main character is accompanied by companions, some of which appeared in the previous installments of the series (e.g. Varric). Not only do they provide invaluable help during combat, but they are also an important part of the story. By talking with them, the player can learn their history, motives, and goals. What's more, player's actions affect how the companions perceive him/her. Romances, a distinctive feature of the Dragon Age franchise, are also a very important part of the protagonist's relationship with the companions. It is also noteworthy that the developers of Inquisition set themselves the goal of showing the interpersonal relationships in a more natural and mature way, which is reflected mainly in modernized sex scenes.\nThe player often faces moral decisions, in which the traditional distinction between good and evil simply does not work. Some of them are important to the plot and their consequences are not always immediately visible. The possibility of importing saved games allows the Dragon Age veterans to transfer some of the decisions they made in the previous installment of the series. The people who, in turn, do not have any experience with the franchise, but would like to outline their own history of the world and its inhabitants, can take advantage of the Dragon Age Keep website that was prepared on the occasion of Dragon Age: Inquisition's launch and enables the players to generate a customized savegame to import.\nApart from the main plot, the player completes side missions and addresses numerous smaller conflicts occurring in Thedas. As the Inquisitor, he or she makes decisions on behalf of the entire organization and thus shaping its reputation and policies towards other groups. Progress in the game not only leads to character development, but also the growing importance of the eponymous Inquisition. Moreover, higher standing gives tangible benefits; for example, an army which can be sent to conquer an impregnable fortress hiding important information. Establishing bridgeheads is a crucial thing, usually in the form of fortresses, in areas of particular importance in order to gain influence and control over the region. What is more, nothing stops the player from expanding his or her keeps and direct their activities (e.g. researches conducted) by managing available human resources.\nBecause of the scope of the events in Dragon Age: Inquisition, the player will travel all over the continent of Thedas. Although the world is not open in the full sense of the word, the locations are much larger and more diverse than in the previous games. Moving between them is done using the world map, and once the character reaches a place, he or sher can freely explore the area on foot or on horseback. To gain access to the key plot areas, the Inquisition, under the player's leadership, must reach a sufficiently high reputation first. To this end, the player must perform side quests, gain the respect of different groups by means of diplomacy, collect magical artifacts, and defeat dangerous beasts.\nWhen it comes to the combat system, the developers tried to appease both the tacticians and the action-lovers. The player can issue orders to the party members while in active pause mode or pass the control over them to the AI in order to focus on one character and fly into battle directly controlling his/her movement and attacks. The main commands are assigned to the keyboard shortcuts. Enemies are typically present in organized and diverse groups. With the improved AI, they can support each other and react to the situation on the battlefield. All of this requires the player to be observant and to use an adequate tactic.\nTechnology\nDragon Age: Inquisition for PC, PS4 and etc. is powered by Frostbite 3 engine, which was employed in Battlefield 4. This technology allows creating large open spaces and complex environment interactions. Not only is it possible to destroy certain elements of the environment, especially during combat, but also to reconstruct them in order to, for example, gain access to previously inaccessible locations.

Just as all the previous games in the franchise, Gran Turismo Sport too was developed by Japanese studio Polyphony Digital, a Sony Computer Entertainment subsidiary.\nGameplay\nThe overall gameplay mechanics in Gran Turismo Sport are the same as before. You climb up the ladder of a professional driver career, taking part in more and more prestigious races and driving more powerful cars. There are many vehicles to choose from, including sport cars, dedicated racing or concept cars. You can take them for a spin on many existing racing tracks from all over the world.Gran Turismo Sport puts even more emphasis on motor sports through the competitive multiplayer. Polyphony Digital started a partnership with FIA organization (Federation Internationale de l\u00e2\u0080\u0099Automobile) to let players compete for prestigious titles and cups, just as real race drivers do. The competition has two layers \u00e2\u0080\u0093 players can either represent their own country or selected car manufacturers.\nTogether with the authentic competitive experience comes an enhanced, realistic driving model. However, the developer took special care to make Gran Turismo Sport as accessible to players as the previous installments.\nTechnology\nSince this is a PlayStation 4 game, Gran Turismo Sport offers much better visuals than the previous games.

It was developed by Firaxis Games, the creators of two expansions for Sid Meier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Civilization V entitled Gods & Kings and Brave New World. Once again, Sid Meier assumed the position of the spiritual and artistic guide of the production, but was not directly involved in the development process. The fifth installment of the series was a great reset of the franchise which simplified many elements that were present in its predecessors. In case of the sixth one, the creators didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to make the same mistake again. All the upgrades of Civilization V\u00e2\u0080\u0099 expansions are therefore present in Civilization VI. Firaxis Games also made use of their experience from working on the 2014\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Sid Meier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Civilization: Beyond Earth.MechanicsSid Meier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Civilization VI is a classical turn-based 4X strategy game. It was developed with both veterans and complete newcomers in mind. The latter can learn all the ins and outs in the extensive tutorial. While playing, we choose one of historical civilizations and then lead it to dominance (that can be achieved in five different ways) by shaping the politics and development direction throughout several thousand years.The first key novelty introduced in Civilization VI is the way we develop cities. Similarly to Endless Legend, they now occupy more than one tile on the map, and where the players want to establish new districts of their metropolis as its population grows it up to them. Districts are divided into four categories: industrial, research, commerce, and military. Depending on their location, they will give us additional bonuses; in case of an enemy city, they inform us of the role they have in the hostile empire. A production bonus is received if an industrial district is built on a mineral deposit, for instance. Additional money will be provided by a trade district built by the river. Military camps have a special role since they grant a walled city a bonus attack in a turn (similarly to Civ 5, cities can destroy enemy units on their own).\nScientific development was also changed. The developers did not abandon the classical technology tree but decided to make it slightly more fun. Almost every invention has an assigned mini-quest that, once completed, will give us a 50% bonus to research in a given technology branch. In practice, this system adjusts to our playstyle. Founding our first city by the sea, we receive the possibility of fast naval development practically right from the start. On the other hand, a civilization in the middle of the continent will have considerable difficulties with researching naval technologies but can be better specialized in agriculture and mining.\nMilitary conflict is an important part of every game. Sid Meier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Civilization V introduced a drastic change that made it impossible for more than one unit to stay on a single tile. Sid Meier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Civilization VI somewhat mitigates this restriction, making it easier to move our armies through the map and adding another strategic aspect to the game. Support units, such as siege towers, cannons, or antiaircraft artillery, can be now attached to a standard unit. Similar protection can also be provided to settlers and workers. This isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t everything, though\u00e2\u0080\u0094 two identical units can be joined in a group called a formation. As technology progresses, we can assign a larger number of soldiers to it, thus creating divisions and armies. They behave just like a single warrior but have the combined strength and defense of all subordinates of which they consist.\nDiplomacy was also subject to significant changes. Each computer-controlled leader now has certain agendas (behavior patterns) that influence his internal policies and relations with neighbors. The first is constant and is a direct result of his character, while the remaining two are hidden and randomly assigned. We can discover them with the use of spies or by careful observation. For example, if an enemy obsessively builds new World Wonders and our empire is better at it, he will try to interrupt us or to conquer the cities that contain the necessary unique buildings.Game modesApart from the single player mode that can be adjusted to our liking by setting the size of the map, amount of raw materials or opponents, Sid Meier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Civilization VI for PC and iOS also offers several multiplayer modes.Technical aspectsSid Meier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Civilization VI is powered by a completely new engine developed with modern PCs in mind.

The production was supervised by Crystal Dynamics, the creators of the previous entries in the series and many other projects, including the Legacy of Kain series. The game was published by Square Enix.PlotShadow of the Tomb Raider takes place after the events depicted in Rise of the Tomb Raider. This time Miss Croft journeys to Latin America, where she travels through the ruins of ancient civilization (including pyramids of Mayans and Aztecs), discovers the mysteries of the Order of Trinity, and learns more about the research conducted by her father. The story is more mature than in previous games. In order to depict Lara as a more advanced adventurer, the developers intended to force her to face the consequences of decisions she made.MechanicsShadow of the Tomb Raider doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t introduce any revolutionary changes to the gameplay mechanics.

Although battles are still important, exploration of tombs, ruins, and forgotten temples and solving environmental riddles is more important. While raiding such locations, players must be cautious as the places are filled with traps. It is worth mentioning that Lara is very experienced with climbing and performing amazing stunts (jumping over cliffs is nothing for her). She can also dive in order to check sunken ruins.Because the game takes place in Latin America, the jungle is an important part of the game. It is inhabited by wild animals and it enables Lara to develop her survival skills. During the game she learns how to take advantage of her surroundings, to hide in the bushes (which is even more effective if she uses mud camouflage), to quietly eliminate enemies or to set traps for them. The jungle is also a great source of resources that can be used in the advanced crafting system. The crafting enables the players to increase backpack capacity, take more ammunition and arrows, create bandages that are used for healing wounds. In addition to having weapons, Lara is equipped with various tools that make exploration easier.

Thanks to this, the movements of the fighters look even more real and differ from one player to another. In addition, the mechanics of the fight in the collar have been rebuilt. Players now have more control over their players by increasing the number of zones they can attack and in which they must defend themselves. New behaviours include special head movements or a precise system of transition from defence to counter-attack. The range of attacks on the ground floor was also expanded, which is a response of the developers to make this kind of fight a hallmark by some competitors. The gameplay is improved by simpler control, using the buttons on the pad more often than the analogue sticks. It is also important that players behave differently depending on their weight category. We fight in many arenas, differing in appearance and character. Among them we can find the famous UFC Apex hall or urban arenas inspired by American suburbs.One of the hallmarks of the series is the option to play with the biggest MMA stars. The fourth part is no different: during the game, we can play as Tyson Fury, Anthony Joshua or the legend of action cinema, Bruce Lee. As for the players we have created, a lot of new options have been added to personalise their appearance. The tattoo creator has changed and our avatar has been equipped with a mask, a crown or hats.Game modes\nThe main mode of EA Sports UFC 4 remains the career mode. In addition to the octagon fights, it also involves taking care of regular training of a player created by us or a selected existing player. In the available exercises, mini-games associated with specific actions have been removed and replaced by sparring, during which we develop our player's skills. In addition, we must take care of our relations with the media and investors, which enables us to win better contracts.\nIn addition to the career, we have an Quick Fight mode at our disposal.

Since early childhood the main character has been aware of things invisible to others - from her birth she is linked with Aiden, a mysterious entity who has penetrated into our world.

During the game we play the role of a hero, who gradually climbs the career ladder, gaining a reputation and earning more and more money.MechanicsIn Need for Speed: Heat we have at our disposal a large city with an open structure. The game takes place here on two planes. During the day, we can travel around the metropolis freely, facing specially prepared challenges and looking for collectibles, as well as taking part in legal Speedhunters Showdown races and winning money. As the streets are patrolled by the police, it is important to be careful not to break the law in front of the police. However, even if we fall under the \"uniformed\" people, they will deal with us quite gently.The situation changes dramatically after dark (which is triggered manually), when we can try our hand at illegal competitions to increase our reputation and gain unique tuning parts. Then corrupt law enforcement forces take to the streets, and they will have no hesitation in getting their drivers. Depending on how much we get behind their skin, our level of publicity is rising, and not only police cars, but also armoured vehicles and even helicopters are sitting on our tails. Although the game is worth the candle, because the bigger our publicity is, the more reputation points we gain, to make use of the latter you should lose the chase and go to your hiding place (in case of \"mishaps\" the prizes won will be taken away from us). The latter is not the only easy one, because every car has a life belt, and if we empty it, hitting other vehicles or elements of the environment, we will be immobilized.\nThe reputation points mentioned above are primarily used to unlock new tuning parts based on the products of real manufacturers, but in order to use them, we also need to spend a certain amount of money on them. The title offers a wide range of possibilities for car personalisation; we can make both optical and mechanical modifications. The list of the former includes a change in the color of the body, lights, tyres or license plates, as well as the installation of spoilers, thresholds and bumpers (or their overlays) or finally the replacement and adjustment of the appearance of rims (among them we will find models modelled on the products of real manufacturers) and the change in the sound of the exhaust. Mechanical tuning mainly involves the replacement of the engine (for the first time in history) of the series. In addition, we are free to replace certain components, adapting the car to the specific type of competition. Even though the driving model is arcade, the differences between the different cars are noticeable; moreover, a drift-ready vehicle will not necessarily work in off-road or cross-country races where the place at the finish line counts. It is worth noting that the personalization also applies to our driver.\nAs for the cars we buy with the money we earn, we can find on their list both cult classics like Aston Martin DB5 from 1964, Buick GNX (1987), Dodge Charger (1969) or Ferrari Testarossa Coupe (1984), as well as modern vehicles. The latter include not only sports cars that can be found on the road (BMW M4 GTS, Chevrolet Corvette, Honda Civic Type-R, Nissan 370Z), but also supercars (headed by Pagani Huayra BC, McLaren 570S, Lamborghini Huracan or Ferrari LaFerrari).Game modesNeed for Speed: Heat can be played both alone and in multiplayer mode.Technical aspectsNeed for Speed: Heat has high quality 3D graphics.

A team of 250 of ZeniMax Online Studios has been working on the game since 2007.The action takes place a thousand years before the events of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. The story revolves around the pact that was signed between the Thern family and the powerful necromancer, Mannimarco. This agreement is related to an attempt to recover the power that the Empire had lost and to extend its influence further. The aristocracy of the continent of Tamriel do not know, however, that Mannimarco formed an alliance with a powerful demon, Molag Bal, whose goal is to seize control over the world. Thanks to this dark alliance, the fallen heroes can be brought back to life and keep on fighting battles. The developers intend the game\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plot to be a prelude to a much more complex one. The players can choose the faction their character will belong to. There are three factions, each of those fights the Empire and is in possession of a powerful army. These factions are Ebonheart Pact (consisting of Nords, Dunmer and Argonian), Dominion Aldmeru (Salache, Bosmeri and Khajiit), and Daggerfall Covenant (Orcs, Bretons, Redgards). The ultimate goal of theirs is to conquer the Empire\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capital. The leader of the successful faction will be made the emperor and will obtain special privileges. In addition, the protagonist can join one of several organizations of characters with appropriate skills. These include Mages, Thieves, and Warriors guilds.The game\u00e2\u0080\u0099s world, which the player can freely explore without hurry, is much bigger than that of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. As a result, for the first time in the history of the series, the players can, for example, visit the motherland of the Khajiit race \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Elsweyr. The gameplay itself resembles a mix of similar MMO titles with the existing style of The Elder Scrolls. The players take quests and that way they learn about the events which the primary and secondary plots are made of. The developers put a strong emphasis on random events that can happen to the player\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character at any time, for example, an unexpected bandit attack.The combat system, which is the crucial element of The Elder Scrolls games, is based on the one known from the single-player installments of the series \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the left mouse button is attack, the right is block. This makes The Elder Scrolls Online much more attractive and dynamic than traditional MMORPGs. The ZeniMax Online studio created a hero development system inspired by The Elder Scrolls series and MMORPG games. Characters still practice the skills they use the most but the experience points were also introduced. The PvP mode is worthy of mention, as well. The players can take part in capturing castles and fortresses with the use of siege engines or take over mines, farms, etc. Up to 200 players can participate up to 200 players.The game graphics looks fantastic, and at first glance resembles the one known from MMOs such as Star Wars: The Old Republic, RIFT, or Everquest II.

Brian Fargo, the creator of the original game and The Bard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Tale, was put in charge of the development process.\nStory\nDeveloped 25 years later, the sequel takes place fifteen years after the events of its predecessor. Yet again the player assumes the role of a member of Desert Rangers who are the only surviving representatives of the U.S. Army after the nuclear war drove the mankind to the verge of extinction. The developers put a special emphasis on character development system that is entirely player-dependent and emphasizing the consequences of the player\u00e2\u0080\u0099s choices made during the journey through the post-apocalyptic wasteland. Missions can be perform in various ways depending on the skills the player develops. Moreover, the game not only allows to personalize the characters, but also weapons, or even the interface.\nGameplay\nWasteland 2 for PC, PS4 and etc. does not follow the trends present in today's productions and offers the players a very classic RPG gameplay. Combat is turn-based, the perspective is isometric, and the wasteland is cruel and unforgiving. In addition, the game consists of numerous references and borrowings from the original Wasteland.The dialogue system in Wasteland 2 is based on a keyword library when interacting with NPCs. During the conversation, the list expands to shows new items that when chosen, take to the next topics of dialogue, and then provide entries to the library. The developers fulfilled the request of the players so each keyword is woven into a full sentence. In this way, the characters controlled by the players speak complete sentences, not only the keywords, and receive a complete answer.\nThe keywords themselves are divided into two categories: local and regional. Local ones relate only to a given conversation, while the regional are important for many characters and their knowledge opens up new dialogue options. The game pays a sort of tribute to retrogaming \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the players can enter their own keyword suggestions into the console and hopefully discover some unique dialogue options. This is only an interesting addition however, and not something that decides the way the plot is going.\nThe library of keywords is also replenished with new items through interaction with the environment. This means that the use of appropriate skills related to the study of land, buildings, and objects in the game, allows you to discover new keywords which can be used later during conversations with NPCs.\nNPC reactions depend on a large number of factors. These include: team members, decision made up to a certain point, previously used keywords, the player\u00e2\u0080\u0099s responses to NPC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s questions, and skills and attributes possessed by the characters. Wasteland 2 for PC, PS4 and etc. offers a huge variety of possible outcomes of dialogues that are never formed according to the principle: one keyword - one specified reaction. Even the order of use of keywords during the conversation has a huge impact on their course.\nThe combat system is characterized by a shift from the so-called phenomenon of continuous change of weapons for better ones. In Wasteland 2 there is no such situation in which in the course of the plot development the old weapons become less effective and must be replaced by new ones which have much better statistics. It was eliminated by dividing weapons into classes that have their own paths of development. In this way, it is the skill in using a certain type of weapon that determines its effectiveness. Of course, all classes of weapons have their pros and cons. The game also introduces weapons that blur the class divisions. These \u00e2\u0080\u009chybrid\u00e2\u0080\u009d weapons are quite numerous in Wasteland 2.\nTechnology\nThe game uses the Unity engine which is commonly used to power web browser-based games.", "Expected_Rating": "4.9", "Current_Rating": "4.0"}, {"Title": "Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Breakpoint", "Tags": ["Action", "TPP", "sandbox", "TPS", "co-op", "shooters"], "Developer": "Ubisoft", "Publisher": "Ubisoft", "Mode": "single / multiplayer", "Release_Date_Day": "04", "Release_Date_Month": "October", "Release_Date_Year": "2019", "Game_Description": "Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Breakpoint is an open-world third-person shooter from iconic series started in 2001. The title was developed and published by Ubisoft, the company responsible for the franchise.\nPlot\nThe action of Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Breakpoint takes place in the universe used by the previous part of the series - Wildlands. However, this is not a direct sequel, as the title tells a separate story.\nAs we play, we find ourselves on a fictional Pacific island of Aurora to investigate the mysterious loss of contact. Upon arriving at the scene, Nomad, the main character, a member of the Ghost Unit, discovers that the island has been captured by an army of mercenaries composed of former commandos under the command of one Walker (Jon Bernthal, known, aamong others, for his leading role in Netflix's Punisher). The matter is a serious as the island is home to Skell, a corporation that develops advanced technologies for the military. The task of the protagonist is to regain control of the situation and find out why the mercenaries have taken over the island.\nMechanics\nIn Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Breakpoint the action is shown in TPP and FPP when aiming down sights. The devs provide us with an open world, in which we can move around on foot or by using a seleciton of roughly thirty different vehicles. What distinguishes this title from the previous parts of the series is that if we decide to play alone, the main character is no longer accompanied by AI-controlled commandoes.\nA number of missions await completion to push the plot forward; however, in order to make progress, we must carefully look around Aurora and obtain intelligence (mainly through conversations with NPCs, interrogating enemies and collecting intelligence materials). In addition, we can deal with various tasks and side activities.\nAlthough the combat plays an important role here (we can unlock new weapons, i.e. rocket launchers, complemented by numerous gadgets, such as a burner, enabling us to cut holes in fences), the devs decided to deepen the gameplay, implementing new survival mechanics. For example, a system of wounds and injuries has been introduced, which affects the combat potential of our hero; when shot in the knee, they start to limp, blinded - suffer from sight disorders, while if their chest is damaged, they will cough up blood. All these inconveniences can be cured by various means.\nIn addition, there is nothing to prevent us from using weapons taken from defeated adversaries or hiding their bodies. An important novelty is also the possibility of using natural camouflage; the protagonist may cover themselves with mud to blend in with the environment and set up an ambush for the enemies. In addition, during selected cut-scenes we can choose the lines spoken by our soldier. Breakpoint also offers the possibility to choose the specialization of the hero in the story mode (we develop them as we progress).\nGame modes\nIn addition to the single player campaign, Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Breakpoint features two multiplayer modes, i.e. a co-op story campaign (where we can share our equipment with our companions in special camps and move wounded allies to a safe place) and the Ghost Wars mode based on PvP rules. It is worth noting that character progression is shared in all game modes.\nTechnical issues\nTom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Breakpoint features high-quality 3D graphics. The environment is detailed and the silhouettes of the characters and weapon models boast a high number of details. This is complemented by realistic lighting.It is worth noting that the game's development and scenario were supervised by a military advisor - Emil Daubon - who has been serving with the American Green Berets since 2005.", "Expected_Rating": "3.4", "Current_Rating": "4.6"}, {"Title": "Mafia: Definitive Edition", "Tags": ["Action", "TPP", "vehicles", "Gangster", "sandbox", "TPS", "reeditions/remasters/remakes", "shooters", "action adventure", "interwar period", "Find Your Next Game"], "Developer": "Hangar 13", "Publisher": "2K Games", "Mode": "single player", "Release_Date_Day": "25", "Release_Date_Month": "September", "Release_Date_Year": "2020", "Game_Description": "Mafia: Definitive Edition is a remake of the cult action adventure game by Illusion Softworks from 2002.

The action of the game takes place in the fictional American city of Lost Heaven in the last years of the interwar period (1930-1938). The main hero is Thomas Angelo, a young taxi driver looking to earn money even in the most suspicious districts. When his last course results in a confrontation with an influential family of mobsters, Thomas miraculously manages to reach a restaurant belonging to the competitive mafia with his clients. This is how the story of the protagonist's relationship with the Salieri family begins, which many years later will lead Thomas to police questioning as a crown witness. His memories are revealed in the form of flashbacks during the conversation with the detective.Although the authors did not change the basic assumptions of the script, there were some modifications. The developers expanded the plot background of the characters and added cutscenes and dialogues absent from the original.\nGameplay\nAs with the story, so with the gameplay Mafia: Definitive Edition essentially remains true to the original game. So we have a vast city as if in a sandbox games like the Grand Theft Auto series, and the world is seen from the third person perspective. Here we have everything that we could expect: collecting a \"protection\" fees, trading stolen goods and skirmishes with rival gangs. In the meantime we get to know the story of Thomas Angelo, presented in the form of non-interactive scenes.\nThere is a high difficulty level combined with the need to respect road traffic regulations. Not stopping at lights or speeding may provoke the police to give us a mandate. More serious offences such as walking around with guns or acts of violence will result in more interest on the part of law enforcement officers, which may result in arrest or even shooting.\nNovelties in the Mafia: Definitive Edition comes down to improving the gameplay in comparison to the original. However, the developers have also introduced a handful of additional sequences to add variety to the fun. However, we will not find any side activities during the main campaign. Several additional tasks are available in the separately selectable Free Ride Mode.\nRemake\nUnlike the remasters of the second and third part, Mafia: Definitive Edition was created from scratch on the Illusion Engine. Remake modernizes the locations and characters models, but does not change the overall design of the game. The same applies to the soundtrack - the authors have recorded again some of the compositions known from the original with the support of a professional orchestra.\nExtras\nWhen you buy a game you get a unique outfit and a car in the other games from the Mafia: Trilogy package.", "Expected_Rating": "7.3", "Current_Rating": "6.9"}, {"Title": "LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga", "Tags": ["Arcade", "TPP", "science fiction", "Star Wars", "LEGO", "3D platformers", "videos", "humorous", "for 2 people", "co-op", "Find Your Next Game"], "Developer": "Traveller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Tales / TT Games", "Publisher": "Warner Bros.

Sledgehammer Games, WWII developers, aimed to recreate the war with reasonable realism, considering the genre standards, and focus on the cooperation between the soldiers during battles. Though the game follows the trail of the previous games of the series, Sledgehammer Games made some bold decisions and implemented some changes and tweaks in gameplay mechanics. As usual, the game offers a single player campaign, a couple of multiplayer modes, and the new incarnation of the popular Zombie mode.The PlotAs the title suggests, Call of Duty: WWII for PC, PS4 and XONE take place during the second World War. In the single player campaign, players will follow the story of a small military unit that was a part of the famous 1st Infantry Divisuion (the Big Red One).

First of all, our protagonist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friends play a bigger role ine the game than before. The game has no automatic health regeneration (a solution that many thought was a permanent element of Call of Duty games). We will have to ask our brothers in arms for ammunition and health kits.Game ModesAlong with the single player campaign, Call of Duty: WWII for PC, PS4 and XONE offers a wide range of multiplayer modes. The newest, narrated mode called War stands out among them. In it, players will take part in the most important battles of the European theatre of war. Additionally, the game comes with a social hub called Headquarters. We can meet other players there outside the battle. Our character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s class (we can be a tankman, a paratrooper, or a standard infantry soldier), looks, and equipment can be customized with the so-called Division mechanics.

The players take on the role of three main characters - a CIA operator, a British policeman and a femal guerilla leader - who make a desperate attempt to find a stolen cargo of chemical weapons. During the missions we visit various corners of the world - from metropolises like London and St. Petersburg to the Middle East in the fictitional state of Urzykistan.\nMechanics\nIn Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, the action is shown from FPP. The pillar of the game is a story campaign in which we perform a variety of tasks, both secret missions, where silent operation is required, as well as extensive military operations. While playing, we make use of a modern arsenal of firearms and various gadgets useful on the battlefield.\nGame modes\nIn addition to the story campaign, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare offers a multiplayer mode. It allows for online duels with other players, as well as cooperation in specially prepared operations. Interestingly, the experience gained during the game is common for all modes. It is worth noting that the title supports cross-platform gameplay between PCs and consoles.\nTechnical aspects\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare is powered by a new engine, which was created by a Polish branch of Infinity Ward. It guarantees high-quality visuals, which are accompanied by audio layer supporting the Dolby ATMOS technology. Moreover, in order to make their work as realistic as possible (also with regard to violence), the authors have established cooperation with Navy SEALs soldiers who, among other things, took part in motion capture sessions.", "Expected_Rating": "4.6", "Current_Rating": "7.645"}, {"Title": "inFamous: Second Son", "Tags": ["Action", "TPP", "science fiction", "sandbox", "superheroes", "action adventure", "PlayStation exclusive titles"], "Developer": "Sucker Punch Productions", "Publisher": "Sony Interactive Entertainment", "Mode": null, "Release_Date_Day": "21", "Release_Date_Month": "March", "Release_Date_Year": "2014", "Game_Description": "inFamous: Second Son is a third-person action game developed by the Sucker Punch studio, associated with the PlayStation brand. As in the previous parts of the series, the player takes control of a young man possessing supernatural abilities and explores the open environment (sandbox). The game is also characterized decision-making which makes the main character either a hero or a hated villain, and having to engage in more and more demanding battles with many hostile characters, including those endowed with supernatural powers as well.The main character of the game is Delsin Rowe, a young resident of Seattle who dabbles in street art. The action of Second Son begins shortly after Delsin acquires supernatural powers in a completely accidental manner, and as a result becomes the next target of the members of of a government special unit responsible for fighting people endowed with superpowers (Department of Unified Defense). Delsin is fortunately not alone in fighting the soldiers of that organization, because he can count on support from his brother, Reggie, and other wanted people possessing supernatural abilities he encounters.Delsin, unlike Cole, the protagonist of the preceding game, does not necessarily have to climb tall buildings, because he has the ability to convert into smoke, and can therefore enter many places through ventilation shafts. Later in the game, the protagonist acquires completely different powers, allowing him, inter alia, to derive energy from the neon lights in the town, to move at high speeds, or to make huge jumps. The game allows to develop the abilities of the main character, so that he learns completely new movements or improves those that already has (such as reduced energy needs or greater firepower).The opponents in the game are mostly individuals that are part of the local authority which is permanently engaged in surveillance of the citizens. An interesting fact is that some of the soldiers subordinate to the Department of Unified Defense possess different types of supernatural powers, such as being able to block Delsin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attack or to jump over the roofs of the buildings. In the game, there are also interesting bosses and fight scenes with opponents using different transportation such as armored vehicles or helicopters. It is also necessary to eliminate the surveillance and security systems installed in the city.In inFamous: Second Son the karma mechanism from the first game that continuously evaluates all actions of the player was preserved. Helping the people of Seattle or rescuing friendly people possessing supernatural powers lets you earn good karma, and murder of innocent civilians or executions on local authorities leads to the accumulation of bad karma. Depending on the chosen path of karma, Delsin gains different powers and, in addition, some main missions take completely different course. In addition, attitude of the inhabitants of the city towards Delsin change. They can either cheer him or pelt him with insults.The game takes place in the city of Seattle and partly the adjacent wooded area. This metropolis is divided into several districts over which we can gradually take control and expel the army of the Department of Unified Defense. In the game, we spend a lot of time running around the streets and jumping over the roofs of skyscrapers, but there are also areas such as harbors and locations of recreation (parks, markets, etc.).", "Expected_Rating": "8.8", "Current_Rating": "7.095"}, {"Title": "Frostpunk", "Tags": ["Strategy", "science fiction", "steampunk", "Economic", "RTS", "Post Apocalypse", "survival", "Polish", "city builder", "Find Your Next Game", "EA Play"], "Developer": "11 bit studios", "Publisher": "11 bit studios", "Mode": "single player", "Release_Date_Day": "11", "Release_Date_Month": "October", "Release_Date_Year": "2019", "Game_Description": "Frostpunk for PC is another production by 11 bit studios, known for the Anomaly series and This War of Mine.

The new game is available not only on PC / Windows and Xbox One, but also PlayStation 4.Designed by Arkane Studios, creators of the Dishonored series, Prey is a FPS game enriched with psychological horror elements. Like in the original, 2006\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Prey, the player\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main objective is to fight hostile extraterrestrials. Unlike in the original however, where the action is very important and players have many kinds of weapons and ammo at their disposal, the 2017\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Prey focuses more on futuristic gadgets (such as the GLOO Cannon) and particular abilities of the main protagonist, e.g. the ability to camouflage by assimilating to objects from the environment. The 2017\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Prey differs from the original in many other aspects, like the story or the represented world, and it has nothing to do with the cancelled project referred to as Prey 2, which was in development by Human Had Studios (the creators of the original 2006\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Prey) until 2014.PlotThe main protagonist of the game is Morgan Yu \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a man or a woman, depending on the player\u00e2\u0080\u0099s choice \u00e2\u0080\u0093 who is a part of a scientific project working on enhancing the human race.

Our goal is to survive the uneven fight with the powerful enemy using items and weapons we find on our way.MechanicsThe action of the game is set in a number of non-linear locations, thus the players can experience some leeway as how and when to complete particular tasks. There are no scripted sequences \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the developers decided to replace them with sophisticated simulation algorithms so as to make each playthrough unique.\nThe PS4 release of Prey is not a typical shooter: neither weapons nor the ammunitions lie around just waiting for the player to pick them up, instead the gameplay is based on utilizing a variety of abilities, futuristic gadgets and the elements of the environment. Quite early in the game players get their hands on the GLOO Cannon, a futuristic gadget shooting with white sticky substance. It serves not only to fight enemies by immobilizing them (e.g. sticking them to the floor), but also to explore Talos 1. The goo from the GLOO Cannon can create a wide range of structures like stairs, allowing the player to reach otherwise inaccessible areas. Another interesting device is the Recycle Charger, similar to a hand grenade gadget used to clear locations of items, disintegrate them and constructing new objects, as long as one has appropriate blueprints. Additionally, the main protagonist finds on his / her way Neuromods, devices allowing him / her to copy the extraterrestrials\u00e2\u0080\u0099 abilities \u00e2\u0080\u0093 e.g. after performing this on a Mimic, our protagonist can camouflage by transforming into any object.\nAmong the opponents, one can find various alien creatures, including the aforementioned Mimics, who can assume the shape of practically any object.

Apart from the wars in which Japan is plunged into, yokai, i.e. demons and monsters taken straight from the mythology of Japan, are a danger.

Production is characterized by a high difficulty level, which increases significantly when the demons draw us into the Dark Realm - the place where they came from.

An important new feature is the ability to turn into a demon, which makes the hero stronger and more resistant to damage.\nAs we progress, we gain experience points and advance to the next levels, developing the main character's combat skills; in addition, we increase his combat potential by gaining better equipment.

To fulfill his goal, the hero crosses the borders of the Forbidden Lands separated from the rest of the world and enters into a pact with a dark force known as Dormin.

After winning, Wander wakes up in the temple, where he accepts the next task of annihilating another opponent.The fights take place in real time and different sceneries (on land, in water, in the skies). Individual enemies differ not only in appearance and size but also in their characteristics and weaknesses. While some Colossuses walk majestically on the surface or fly calmly in the air and don't attack unprovoked, others behave more chaotic and aggressive. The latter happens especially when Wander climbs over their furry parts of the body (to avoid a painful fall, pay attention to the endurance indicator), trying to reach one of the weak points - we need to stab it with the sword several times to weaken the enemies. Some fights also require us to use Agro's help - the mount is a real support on the battlefield, because it can distract the opponent's attention (we can also use a bow) and allows him to get to hard to reach places.

Bush, which ensures the continuity of the federal government in the event of an extraordinary threat to the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s security. The developers from Massive Entertainment created an alternative vision of history, in which the fictional operation Dark Winter, so far only a simulated bioterrorist attack scenario, actually happened.\nThe action of The Division starts on Black Friday, the special offers and sales day that begins the pre-Christmas shopping period in the United States. This was the date that the terrorists from an unknown organization chose to paralyze the world with a deadly virus, transmitted by American banknotes that are passed from hand to hand. When, as a result of their operation, New York is struck with a pandemic and the panicked citizens are ready to do anything to survive, the Division, the eponymous secret agency, goes into action. Its agents, controlled by the players, not only have to face the deadly virus and its effects, but also deal with the terrorists responsible for the attack.\nGameplay\nTom Clancy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s The Division for PS4 focuses primarily on cooperative multiplayer, combining elements of typical third-person shooters with open world and some RPG accents. The players, who assume the role of the Division operators, try to contain the situation in a city overrun by panic, which in practice boils down to free exploration of the game world and undertaking lots of primary and secondary quests. Their most important element is dynamic combat. Its mechanics heavily resemble the solutions known from such games as Tom Clancy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Ghost Recon, offering opportunities for tactical maneuvers and hiding behind covers.\nFor completing quests, our character is awarded with experience points that can be spent on developing dozens of skills. They allow us to, for example, heal our teammates, scan our surroundings to detect nearby enemies, set up machine gun nests, or use remote-controlled mines that seek out hostiles and explode near them. The game world constantly changes as a result of the decisions made by the players. The retaking of New York is particularly interesting. For instance: after we secure one of the local police stations, the policemen stationed therein will attempt take control of its surrounding area and the restore order within it.\nGame modes\nTom Clancy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s The Division focuses on multiplayer, therefore, similarly to most classical online games, the key to success is the skillful cooperation between team members. Should we not have enough friends to play with, we may use the matchmaking feature. One of the important aspects of cooperation is not only fighting together against the terrorists, but also trading the equipment gathered during the game. Furthermore, the developers from Massive Entertainment did not forget about the fans of competitive gameplay \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The Division offers some PvP elements that allow for rivalry between player characters.\nTechnology\nTom Clancy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s The Division for PS4 is powered by the proprietary Snowdrop engine that delivers impressive graphics on all platforms. According to the developers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 announcements, virtually all visible objects are rendered separately, which translates into incredibly detailed game world, as well as a number of additional visual effects, such as air escaping from punctured tires, car bodies penetration, or completely different trajectory of bullet cases ejected from weapons.", "Expected_Rating": "8.9", "Current_Rating": "7.0"}, {"Title": "Mass Effect: Andromeda", "Tags": ["RPG", "TPP", "science fiction", "TPS", "co-op", "action RPG", "Role-playing shooter", "EA Play"], "Developer": "BioWare", "Publisher": "Electronic Arts Inc.", "Mode": "single / multiplayer", "Release_Date_Day": "21", "Release_Date_Month": "March", "Release_Date_Year": "2017", "Game_Description": "Mass Effect: Andromeda for PC, PS4 and etc. is another installment in action-RPG series started several years ago by BioWare.

However, encounters with the above mentioned T-800s look a bit different, as they are extremely resistant to damage and have a powerful attack force, so we must initially sneak behind their backs and avoid direct confrontations at all costs; only with time does our combat potential grow so much that we can stand up to our equals with them.Technical aspectsTerminator: Resistance three-dimensional graphics are decent; the most notable are the opponents, who are designed with great attention to detail, and their metal armour gradually deteriorates during the firefight.

In contrast to the original, this version features updated visuals and supports 1080p.PlotThe main hero of Uncharted: Drake\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Fortune is Nathan Drake. You meet him while he finds the lost coffin with his supposed ancestor \u00e2\u0080\u0093 sir Francis Drake. As it turns out, the coffin does not contain the body of the traveller, but his journal with hints concerning the whereabouts of legendary El Dorado. Having found that, the hero sets off on a journey to a mysterious island hiding the treasure. Luckily for him, Nathan has faithful friends on his side, who turn out to be more helpful than they firstly seemed. There is Sully \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a longtime friend of the protagonist - and Ellena, a TV reporter. Naturally for such adventure stories, the heroes quickly find themselves in the middle of trouble, as pirates, who are usually not very kind to competitors, are also after El Dorado.Seasoned with a big dose of specific humour, the plot draws on Hollywood action movies, such as Indiana Jones.MechanicsUncharted: Drake\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Fortune for PS4 is a third-person perspective title. It is divided into chapters in which you visit a number of various locations \u00e2\u0080\u0093 apart from a dense jungle, Drake stops at mysterious caves and even WW II bunkers. The topography is varied, so you often need to climb, swing on lines, or walk over precipices on fallen trees. The second aspect of gameplay consists in solving more or less complicated environment puzzles primarily based on manipulating the environment elements. This is where the journal comes in handy \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it contains useful hints concerning solutions to the puzzles.\nDue to the fact that Drake is followed by the pirates, the player takes part in numerous shootouts and chases. Luckily, the protagonist is not defenceless, and makes use of a wide arsenal of weapons \u00e2\u0080\u0093 starting with pistols, through machine guns, ending with sniper rifles and grenade launchers (he can wield up to two weapons at the same time). The hero uses covers, but you need to keep in mind that enemy bullets can damage more fragile ones, and enemies themselves often change positions. Therefore, applying proper tactics depending on the situation in the battle is the key to success. Gameplay is even more varied, as Nathan is doing very well at hand-to-hand combat \u00e2\u0080\u0093 if he runs out of ammo, he can resort to close combat. Various collectibles serve as a nice break from core gameplay \u00e2\u0080\u0093 many of 60 treasures are hidden in seemingly unreachable places.Technical aspectsUncharted: Drake\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Fortune published on PS4 features amazing, 3D graphics. The diligently-created and detailed environment (especially the lush flora), realistically-animated characters, and the dynamic lighting really attract the eye. Naturally, sounds also deserve special recognition \u00e2\u0080\u0093 this is true to both the soundtrack and the professional voiceover.", "Expected_Rating": "7.2", "Current_Rating": null}, {"Title": "Chivalry 2", "Tags": ["Action", "FPP", "the middle ages", "network", "Find Your Next Game"], "Developer": "Torn Banner Studios", "Publisher": "Tripwire Interactive", "Mode": "multiplayer", "Release_Date_Day": "08", "Release_Date_Month": "June", "Release_Date_Year": "2021", "Game_Description": "Chivalry II is a network action game that allows players to take part in medieval battles.

The game focuses on battles with other players using various melee weapons, as well as bows and crossbows. One of the novelties in comparison to its predecessor is the possibility of ride horses. The production is set in a fictional universe inspired by Hollywood films and the authors focus mainly on the spectacularity of the battles, not their realism.The game offers an extensive combat system that allows players to control every movement with the mouse.

Produced by Square Enix, the title was initially announced in 2006 as a PlayStation 3 exclusive; it was then called Final Fantasy Versus XIII and advertised as a part of the Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy XIII compilation. Initially, Tetsuya Nomura, a genre veteran who worked as a creative producer and designer on the Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy series, as well as such productions as Parasite Eve and The World Ends with You, was appointed as the game\u00e2\u0080\u0099s director. For many years, the development process of Final Fantasy Versus XIII was incredibly slow and the production team managed to create only a skeleton of gameplay mechanics and a brief outline of the story. In 2013, the game was renamed to Final Fantasy XV and announced for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Hajime Tabata, who previously worked on Final Fantasy Type-0 and Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII, was chosen as the new director.\nStory\nDespite the fact that the developers changed the game\u00e2\u0080\u0099s title, its story is still thematically connected to the productions of Fabula Nova Crystallis. It shares its mythology, including the deities that look after the in-game world along with their servant entities called l\u00e2\u0080\u0099cie.The main protagonist is a young prince, Noctis Lucis Caelum, whose family has been ruling a small and technologically advanced city-state, Lucis, for generations. As the only country in the world, it possesses a powerful magical crystal that provides protection and prosperous life to its inhabitants. For many years, Lucis was isolating itself from the outside world to defend from its neighbors that wished to take over the source of wealth. The biggest opponent is the militarized Empire of Niflheim, which controls almost the entire continent. The mutual animosities and the cold war between the two sides were supposed to be put to an end by a special treaty, signed by both Noctis\u00e2\u0080\u0099 father and the emperor himself. As it turned out, the proposition was but a bluff and on the day of the ratification, Lucis was unexpectedly invaded by the forces of Niflheim, which destroyed the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capital, Insomnia, and killed its ruler.\nWhen Noctis' home was being razed to the ground, he was on the way to the city of Altissia, accompanied by Gladiolus Amicitia (his personal guard), Ignis Stupeo Scientia (a royal counselor), and Prompto Argentum (his childhood friend), where he was supposed to meet with his future wife, Lunafreya \u00e2\u0080\u009cLuna\u00e2\u0080\u009d Nox Fleuret. The marriage with Luna \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a young and incredibly talented Oracle able to communicate with the gods \u00e2\u0080\u0094 was to seal the treaty between Niflheim and Lucis. When the heroes find out what happened to their homeland, they are faced with a huge dilemma and have to carefully plan their next steps, while hiding from the Imperial soldiers hunting them.\nGameplay\nThe gameplay mechanics of the PS4 and XONE version resembles that of the Kingdom Hearts series. The action is observed from the third-person perspective and the exploration of vast, open locations is carried out in real-time. Contrary to the previous games in the series, the combat system focuses on action, therefore we will not experience any classical turn-based battles and duels on separate arenas. Another difference is the fact that the players can control only the main protagonist. In his travels, he is constantly accompanied by his three friends and occasionally and temporarily joined by additional companions.\nNoctis can use magic, special abilities, as well as one of his many magical swords that also fill in for his shield, when necessary. The protagonist can instantly teleport on short distances, as well, surprising his enemies and reaching places which would be otherwise inaccessible. Most of the time, we can make use of our companions\u00e2\u0080\u0099 help with whom we are able to perform coordinated attacks and combos. Combat is further enhanced by the option to drive vehicles and mechs as well as control all kinds of turrets. As the story progresses, we gain the assistance of Archaeans, which are powerful creatures that play the role of classical summons known from the other Final Fantasy games.\nWorld exploration is an important aspect of the game. We travel the map in a car that automatically follows designated roads. We can exit the vehicle at any point, though, and walk off the beaten path, undertaking side quests and looking for various secrets. The title features a day and night cycle that influences the behavior of wildlife. The player\u00e2\u0080\u0099s party sometimes has to camp in the wilds, because only while resting can they advance their levels. Our health is regenerated by eating meals. Depending on used ingredients, the heroes may receive additional offensive or defensive bonuses that prove important especially while fighting the most powerful opponents.\nTechnology\nFinal Fantasy XV for PS4 and XONE is powered by both proprietary Square Enix technologies as well as the Unreal Engine 4. The game\u00e2\u0080\u0099s graphics utilize the capabilities of DirectX 11. As far as world and character designs are concerned, the developers drew inspirations from classical fantasy iconography and contemporary landscapes of places like Tokyo, Venice, the United States, or the Caribbean.

His life's goal is to rebuild the country and bring it back to its glory fifty years ago (when the dictator was his father), no matter what sacrifices he has to make to the people. Besides, Castillo is raising his successor, a 13-year-old son named Diego. The protagonist's name is Dani Rojas, a warrior of the local resistance movement, trying to remove Castillo from power through both guerrilla warfare and bloody protests in the streets of Yara's capital Esperanza.MechanicsWe start Far Cry 6 by choosing the sex of the character we're playing.

The authors give us a vast open world, which we travel on foot, at the helm of various vehicles and machines and on the back of a horse.

We are disturbed by our enemies, led by loyal Castillo soldiers, whom we eliminate by making use of an extensive arsenal. Apart from cold weapons, there is a wide range of pistols, rifles and shotguns, which the guerrilla modify with the help of everyday objects (for example by installing sights made of sardine cans). We can deal with our enemies both in open combat and acting quietly, which is all the more important because they often have a numerical and technological advantage over us (enough to say that they have tanks among others). As was the case at Far Cry 5, we're not condemned to a lonely journey. We can use the so called guns for hire (other revolutionaries) or tusks for hire (tame animals like dachshund named Chorizo).Technical aspectsFar Cry series has got us used to the fact that the games representing it have a high quality graphic design.

We decide for ourselves how to divide the energy between motors, laser guns and shields. Setting one of these categories to maximum limits the performance of the others, but provides access to additional functionality. For example, the maximum power supply of the engine allows you to take advantage of short term high acceleration.\nThe shields regenerate automatically, and in the case of hull damage it is necessary to use support units or return to the flag ship.

Balrog, Witch-king of Angmar, and Sauron himself.MechanicsSimilarly to the first installment in the series, in Middle Earth: Shadow of War for PS4, players get to explore a vast open world featuring such iconic locations as Osgiliath, Cirith Ungol, Gorgoroth, Nurnen Lake Fortress, and Seregost. One can travel in numerous ways - either on foot or on the back of various steeds. In the former case, a player can enjoy the elaborate free running system, which highly resembles the one featured in Assassin's Creed series. Nonetheless, the developers give at players' disposal also a wide range of creatures one can ride on - apart from the karagors we remember from the first installment, there are also dragons, which prove extremely useful when fighting the enemies.\nMiddle Earth: Shadow of War delivers dynamic and spectacular combat system once again based on attack combinations and mounting counterattacks. Interestingly enough, this time around, a player gets to participate in epic battles aided by entire armies comprising orcs and battle beasts with unique skills. Apart from the aforementioned dragons, a player can have in his army karagors, trolls, and graugs, which are now more diversified - an ice graug, for example, can throw blocks of ice at his enemies. Nonetheless, there is still nothing standing on player's way to eliminate his targets silently and work stealthily.\nWhat made Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor different from other action games was the Nemesis system, which generates unique enemies with their own stories, motivations, traits, and weaknesses. It also allowed the opponents who have beaten the main protagonist to become even more powerful and eventually become a general in the Dark Lord's army. Moreover, Celebrimbor could possess any opponent turning him into a saboteur or a spy, who unconsciously worked for the main protagonists. All this has been also implemented into the game described herein, however, the Nemesis system has undergone many changes and improvements. The adversaries are now even more diverse; moreover, they have been divided into different tribes. A player cannot possess the minds of elite opponents right away - in the initial stages of the game, when both Talion's and Celebrimbor's abilities are still waiting to be developed, one can only mess with them and indirectly downgrade them. What is more, even a possessed orc can turn on the main protagonists - whether one remains loyal to us depends on his nature and the way we decide to treat him.\nThe Nemesis system is directly linked to conquering strongholds, which requires a player to employ successful strategies and gathering enough forces to pull it off. Conquering a stronghold results in taking control over a region of Mordor. As the castle might fall victim to an enemy attack, one should appoint a proper warden - potential candidates for this post offer unique benefits.\nIn comparison to the first installment, the game described herein offers much more elaborate RPG elements. By looting the bodies of fallen enemies, one can come across new weapons and armor featuring various statistics. Moreover, some pieces of equipment have additional unique traits, which can be unlocked after completing more or less complex tasks. A player can also improve his gear with special jewels, while the new Ring of Power can be improved with runes. To top it all, the game delivers a set of active and passive skills, which are unlocked as one progresses through the story.Technical aspectsThe PS4 release of Middle Earth: Shadow of War delivers top-quality 3D visuals. Both character and enemy models, as well as the environment textures, are rich with details and well-complemented with the spectacular animations (visible especially during the dynamic fighting sequences) and the realistic lighting effects. Also worth mentioning, is the atmosphere of the game and the dedicated soundtrack accompanying a player on his journey through the volcanic wastelands of the Dark Land.", "Expected_Rating": "9.0", "Current_Rating": "7.035"}, {"Title": "Far Cry 5", "Tags": ["Action", "FPP", "sandbox", "FPS", "co-op", "crafting", "shooters"], "Developer": "Ubisoft", "Publisher": "Ubisoft", "Mode": "single / multiplayer", "Release_Date_Day": "27", "Release_Date_Month": "March", "Release_Date_Year": "2018", "Game_Description": "Far Cry 5 for PC, PS4 and XONE is the fifth installment of the best-selling first-person shooter series developed by Ubisoft Montreal, a subsidiary of the French company Ubisoft. The game was released on many platforms, including PCs. Unlike the series\u00e2\u0080\u0099 previous games that took place in many exotic parts of the world Far Cry 5 takes the players to Montana, one of the least populated states in the USA located in the south west part of the country, near the border with Canada. However, this is not the only changed introduced by the developers. For the first time in the history of the series we are able to create our own character and can finish the game\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story in coop with another player.The PlotFar Cry 5 for PC, PS4 and XONE takes place in the fictional Hope county in the state of Montana. We play as a police officer whose job is to work out and destroy the crime organization that works under the cover of a fanatic religious cult known as The Project At Eden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Gate. The group is led by Joseph Seed who ruthlessly deals with his opponents whom he calls the sinners. Once again we will have to face a sadistical and charismatic villain. We are not alone in our fight. As we play, we will make some allies, like Mary May Fairgrave (Seed kidnapped her family), Nick Rye (a pilot that is concerned with the safety of his family), and pastor Jerome Jeffries (he fights with the fanatics for the greater good).MechanicsJust like the previous games of the series, Far Cry 5 for PC, PS4 and XONE is a first-person shooter. We begin our adventure with the creation of our character. For the first time in the history of the series we get to decide about our hero\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gender and looks. With time, our hero gets access to various special abilities and talents.As usual, we get a game with an open world (the biggest in the history of the Far Cry  series) made of green fields, riverlands, and mountains. Given its size, vehicles play an important role here. Along with cars (like American muscle cars and trucks), we will have the chance to drive quad bikes, tractors, boats, and fly planes. In our fight against the Seed\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Fanatics we will use various guns and cold steel weapons (like clubs, knifes, even pitchforks) which we can modify. We can go full \u00e2\u0080\u0098Rambo\u00e2\u0080\u0099 on our enemies or have a stealthier approach to combat. \nIn addition to the main story, we will find many side quests and additional activities in Far Cry 5. Crafting plays a rather important role in the game (we can fix our weapons or create new tools). We can tame wild animals in order to make them help us in battle, just like in Far Cry Primal. We will also find many allies among the people who live in Hope county. We gain their trust by doing missions for them.Game ModesFar Cry 5 for PC, PS4 and XONE can be played alone or with a friend.

In the mean time, however, developing didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go as expected and we did not hear of NiOh for a while. It has resurfaced again at September 2015 during Tokyo Game Show event, during which the game has been announced once more, this time as a title for PlayStation 4.PlotThe story of NioH for PC and PS4 takes place in alternate version of Sengoku era (15th to 16th century). Japanese provinces are in the midst of civil war, and a\u00a0new great danger appeared in form of dangerous demons called yokai. Meanwhile, a\u00a0blond warrior from the West named William arrives in Japan in his pursuit of Edward Kelly. The hero quickly joins forces with Ieyasu Tokugawa and his servant Hanzo Hattori. Together they will go after the enemy and hunt down yokai.Game mechanicsIn NiOh for PC and PS4, we play as a samurai fighting against various enemies, both human and not. To prevail in battles against monstrous enemies, hero must use not only his skills, but also a power enchanted in his sword. Gameplay resembles a mix between Onimusha and Dark Souls series, forcing player to act cautiously, dodging and blocking, as well as dealing fast and deadly blows.Fighting system bases on three main stances: High, Mid and Low. The first one focuses on performing powerful, high-damaging attacks, but doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t offer much in dodges and blocks.

The production debuted in 2013 on the Nintendo Wii U, and after a few years it was ported to other platforms.\nPot\nThe main character of LEGO City: Undercover is Chase McCain, a police officer who returns to his hometown after a few years of absence. His main task is to apprehend his nemesis - a villain called Rex Fury. The hero starts working \"undercover\", infiltrating the mafia ranks from the inside. The plot is full of references to pop culture - a watchful eye will catch various references to Starsky and Hutch's adventures or Shawshank Redemption. The whole was enriched with a lot of specific humor , characteristic for Traveller's Tales productions.\nMechanics\nLEGO City: Undercover, released on PC, PS4, etc., is an open world game inspired mainly by the Grand Theft Auto series. The titular city consists of twenty different districts, modeled on San Francisco and New York. We traverse this \"sandbox\" built out of bricks by driving various vehicles - cars, helicopters, boats, and even wheelchairs. However, the player can explore LEGO City on foot, using a simplified parkour system to jump over and bypass obstacles.The game offers main and side missions. We take part in spectacular chases, police helicopter flights and other daring actions, taken directly from cult films from the eighties and nineties of the twentieth century. Because of Chase's profession, we often have to use a wide range of costumes unlocked during the game. Disguises grant the player special skills - for example, a miner's outfit allows us to break boulders with a pickax, and the criminal outfit provides the hero with the ability to open locks. Combat is another important element. McCain is skilled in melee combat - he can perform various attacks and counterattacks. There are also platforming elements - by completing them we can get collectibles scattered all over the city or gain access to secret locations. The game even has simple environmental puzzles.\nVarious activities reward us with studs and bricks - we can spend them on new vehicles or constructing special superstructures such as helicopter landings, hills, or sandcastles. These constructions are often required to push the plot forward. The whole is complemented by gadgets, such as an environment scanner highlighting interactive objects.\nTechnical aspects\nLEGO City: Undercover offers decent 3D graphics.

The game was developed by the in-house studio of Ubisoft, based in Toronto.\nPlot\n\nWatch Dogs Legion is taking place in the near future, some time after Brexit (the UK left the European Union), which took place in the game world on 29 March 2019. Since those events, the country (and the whole world) has changed dramatically. Increasing automatism, as well as the dynamic development of Artificial Intelligence research, has led to a dramatic rise in unemployment; the cryptocurrency are starting to crowd out classic money more and more.A government that should, in theory, uphold order and look after the good of its citizens is increasingly oppressing them. At one point in London, a bomb attack takes place in which the hacker group DedSec, which is well-known to fans of the cycle, is framed. As a result, London is controlled by a private military organisation, Albion. Mass surveillance and arrests are the order of the day. Our aim is to find those responsible for this attack and clear the name of DedSec, which is now forming a kind of resistance movement.\nGameplay\nIn Watch Dogs Legion the action is observed from the third person perspective (TPP). The game gives us the slightly cyberpunk incarnation of London - the sky is swarming with drones and the streets are constantly being monitored with thousands of cameras. There is plenty of places characteristic of this city, with Trafalgar Square, Big Ben, Tower Bridge and London Eye at the forefront. We can move around the metropolis on foot (which makes it more attractive to be able to overcome terrain obstacles in a skilful, parked way) or at the helm of one of the futuristic vehicles. The game is driven by a variety of missions, with a wide range of side activities waiting to be checked. \nAn important part of the game are clashes with enemies, which we can eliminate both in open combat and quietly by sneaking behind their backs. In the case of Watch Dogs Legion, the authors decide that they will reduce the killing. Players get a wide range of weapons at their disposal, about half of which only allow for stunning the adversaries. In addition, the game includes various types of gadgets - among them is the smartphone, which is our primary work tool (with its help we hack electronics or scan citizens and adversaries), but our support includes, among others, flying drones or remote-controlled robots resembling spiders.\nUnlike its predecessors, the Watch Dogs Legion has no main character. Instead, we can take control of any neutral character that is sympathetic to the DedSec group; while many NPCs are willing to support our resistance movement from the start, others need to be persuaded to do so, for example by performing special tasks. At any given moment we can have twenty such rebels, between whom we switch at any time.\nIt is important to remember that each potential DedSec member not only has a unique appearance and personality, but also predispositions that are reflected in their perks; while one character can get out of prison more quickly (which will be a moment's notice), others can do more damage when their vitality drops to a critical level, or better deal with the silent elimination of enemies. The people of London have been created on the basis of certain archetypes which influence the unique possibilities of the character class - construction workers have access to a transport drone on call, and police officers or members of Albion can use their faction's clothing at any time to easily sneak through the guarded area. Since the action is taking place in London, a spy based on Agent 007 cannot be missing either. The game features several different character archetypes.\nPermadeath\nAn optional permadeath mechanic has been implemented in the game, which means that if we run the game with this setting, we have no way of resurrecting the character after his death. However, when a hero's life is at stake, players are given a choice - to give up or try to escape. In the first case, the character is taken to the prison, which excludes him from the game for a while; interestingly, we can shorten the stay of a companion behind bars in another person's skin (by pulling him out of there legally or by force). The second option offers a chance to escape and get out of the situation without consequences. However, there is a risk that everything will go wrong and that the controlled NPC will die.

The title was created by newly founded Hangar 13 studio, working under Take-Two Interactive. The studio hires ex-members of 2K Czech (previously known as Illusion Softworks), the team behind the first two parts of the series. This new game by the Czech studio was released on PC and, for the first time in history of the series, on the eight generation consoles.\nStory\nThe game is set in the year 1968, New Orleans. The main character is Lincoln Clay, a veteran of the Vietnam war and a mafia member. However, his \u00e2\u0080\u0098family\u00e2\u0080\u0099 was betrayed and executed without mercy. Therefore, the main theme of the game is revenge on the person responsible for killing Lincoln\u00e2\u0080\u0099s folks - Sal Marcano, the don of Italian mob, who ordered the massacre. In his quest Clay can cooperate with other criminal bosses, including an Irish gangster named Burke, Cassandra, the head of Haitian gang, and Vito Scaletta, the protagonist of Mafia II.\nGameplay\nAlthough Mafia games have always been set in open worlds, in terms of gameplay the third part comes closer to the competing Grand Theft Auto series. The streets of New Orleans are filled with various extra activities, which you are free to complete between main missions. One of the biggest differences between Mafia and GTA is the artificial intelligence of New Orleans' citizens. Similarly to the protagonist, non-player characters can engage in various activities. Therefore, you can come across couples kissing, junkies enjoying their habit, or street musicians.Another new element of key importance is the option of taking over hideouts of hostile gangs. After clearing up a particular location you can hand it down to one of your capos. This generates various bonuses, e.g. an option to call in the \u00e2\u0080\u0098cavalry\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to help you get rid of opponents chasing you, or bribe the police to drop a pursuit.\nThis time the protagonist has a much wider spectrum of abilities. Lincoln can make use of pistols, revolvers, shotguns, machine guns, and grenades, although it is possible to carry only two types of weapons at the same time. The game also features a cover system and dynamic hand-to-hand combat, including brutal knock-downs. Another important element of gameplay is shooting while driving a car \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the driving itself was significantly improved as well. Mafia III has a combined health regeneration system. Health bar is split into three segments, which regenerate automatically unless they drop to zero \u00e2\u0080\u0093 when that happens, you have to use a medkit to fill them up.\nTechnology\nIn contrast to the last two Mafia games, which bore more resemblance to action-adventure games, Mafia III for PC, PS4 and XONE makes a big step towards a sandbox narrative, which is a distinctive characteristic of the GTA series.

The first of these took place hundreds of years before the start of the game, when a small group of people began to show signs of weird mutations, manifested in acquiring the characteristics of a beast. Eventually, a war between the two species breaks out. An order modeled on the Knights of the Round Table, whose members use in the fight against substance with strange properties known as Black Water, takes the side of the humanity. The substance heals wounds and significantly slows down the aging process, allowing knights to continue their mission for centuries.The second key event was the technological revolution caused by the innovative use of steam engines which after centuries of minor and major failures allowed people to start an effective counteroffensive against mutants. During the campaign, the player assumes the role of Sir Galahad, the most famous of the knights of the Order, who has grown tired of his exceptionally long life of constant fight. The game is set in London and the city was carefully mapped. The players will recognize many buildings which in most cases are located at the exact same location as in reality. Naturally, the developers had to make some compromises so it is not an accurate copy of the capital of England, however, it still is pretty impressive.The title represents the genre of action TPP games. The game is linear and has many shooting sequences which use different types of weapons. The mechanics are also based on the cover system, similar to what you see in the Gears of War series. In addition, during the fights, QTE sequences appear, during which time slows down and the player can then avoid blows or use a nearby weapon. Interestingly, the cutscenes are interactive, allowing for partial control of the character (for example: shooting).One of the most important elements of the game are weapons which capabilities are based on the principles of science, but at the same time have fantastic and unique qualities. Among the weapons available is, inter alia, Arc Gun, Combo Gun (two fire modes: repulsive load and regular shooting) and Thermite Rifle (shoots chemicals and incendiary flares).Graphic design is of high quality.

Instead of a complex scenario and sudden twists and turns, we get a simple story about the journey and heroes who have to rely on each other to cope with adversities.\nMechanics\nIn terms of mechanics, Unravel Two is a classic 2.5D platformer.

The game was developed by the BioWare Edmonton studio, the team behind  some of the company's biggest hits, such as the Dragon Age series and  the first three installments of the Mass Effect series.PlotThe game takes us to a distant planet, abandoned by the ancient gods at the time of its creation, which left a lot of hostile beasts and the \"power of anthem\" - a tool of world creation, which everyone wants to possess and tame.  Players take on the role of  Freelancers,  daredevils equipped with Javelin-class powered armour.  Only they are able to face both the aggressive fauna of this world and the ruthless race of intelligent beings known as Scars, as well as the hostile human faction of the Dominion. Players must complete numerous tasks given to them by the inhabitants of Fort Tarsis and defeat the Dominion forces that seek to seize the power of anthem.GameplayAnthem is a combination of third-person shooter and MMORPG.  Players start the adventure by choosing their first Javelin, and then take part in the exploration of the world and complete missions, alone or together with their brothers in arms.  Completing the tasks is rewarded with experience points, thanks to which we level up our character and gain equipment. \nEvents are observed from a camera placed behind the protagonist.  The combat is largely arcade and resembles classic shooters, but the main role is played by Javelin special abilities and area attacks.  The game offers four models of powered armour (Colossus, Storm, Interceptor, and Ranger), with varying levels of mobility and armour; additionally, we can modify and upgrade them.  All units are equipped with jet engines, which facilitates exploration of the planet and provides greater tactical freedom during battles.  It should be noted that the game does not allow for unlimited flying.  Javelin's engines overheat after some time; we can cool them down by, for example, falling flight or contact with water. \nIn Anthem we can complete missions alone, with a group of friends or rely on random companions.  However, the base of humanity, Fort Tarsis, is an individual place for each user.  It is there that we learn about the game's plot and select missions.  Thus, while Anthem main universe unfolds in the same way for each user, at the same time, thanks to the base they have the chance to learn the stories of numerous NPCs of their choice.Co-opAnthem focuses on cooperative gameplay, in which four players join forces against artificial intelligence.  On the day of the premiere, the authors did not provide a PvP option.   The team can be chosen at the start of each new expedition. \nAfter  completing the main storyline (it consists of about twenty tasks),  players can enjoy additional activities.  These include further missions  commissioned by the game's main factions (Freelancers, Arcanists,  Guardsmen), daily challenges and taking over fortifications  (strongholds) always ending in a boss fight.  These activities renew  themselves regularly, providing us with the opportunity for continuous  development.  The hero can advance to a maximum of 30 level of  experience, but this does not end the game.  The strength of his Javelin  is calculated separately - we can increase it by installing rare  components of higher quality.  New weapons and parts can be obtained in  the form of loot or manufactured by ourselves based on crafting.FrostbiteAnthem offers an eye-catching 3D graphics, which was built on the Frostbite engine known from Battlefield 1, among others.  The environments we visit during the game are quite similar to each  other, because we operate all the time on a small area of a mountainous  planet covered with jungle.  Mines, enemy bases or the interiors of caves  and ancient ruins are a certain variety.  The game allows for advanced  modifications of our Javelin's appearance, which are visible during the  actual game and during intermission scenes.  Also noteworthy is Fort  Tarsis, which we explore uniquely from a first-person perspective.Anthem NextAnthem received a cold reception from players and reviewers alike, so it quickly became a priority for the developers to fix this game. In February 2020, it was officially confirmed that the game will receive a thorough overhaul, and the introduced modifications will cover the basic elements of gameplay, led by the progression and reward system. \nPrepared by BioWare big update was referred to as Anthem Next.

After a successful assault on a maharaja city and the possession of a dagger that allows for the reversal of time, the protagonist falls victim to a conspiracy plot plotted by a treacherous vizier who, in order to gain immortality, persuades him to free the Sands of Time from the giant hourglass.

Throughout the years, the Battlefield series have become one of the bestselling war shooter brands in the history of gaming, as well as the main opponent of the Call of Duty franchise developed by Activision.Scheduled on May 6, 2016, the official announcement of the game came as quite a surprise, revealing that this new installment would reach back to the roots of the series, introducing the players to a different time period, which corresponded to what they had demanded for a long time. The PS4 version offers contents identical to what both the PC and Xbox One equivalents include. However, the contents are accompanied by limitations typical of the consoles belonging to the eighth generation of hardware - these concern the visuals looking slightly inferior to what the PC version has to offer when launched on a modern-day computer.PlotAs the title may suggest, Battlefield 1 for PS4 introduces the players to the realities of the First World War, which is an exceptionally rare occurrence in the world of gaming. The plot presents twentieth century's first large military conflict through the eyes of several independent characters involved. Accompanying them, the player witnesses the emergence of the total war, which brought the largest technological developments in the history of warfare. It was during the World War I, when artillery, flamethrowers and nerve agents were all used for the first time. Both tanks and machine guns were being spread wider; also, air support was coming into use. In the story campaign, the player takes part in the largest battles this world has ever seen, taking place in different regions the Great War left its mark on - for instance, narrow streets of French towns, strongly defended forts in Alps (Italy) or sun-drenched deserts of Arabia.MechanicsIn terms of the mechanics, Battlefield 1 for PS4 reaches back to the roots of the franchise, throwing the players into the midst of the conflict and giving them much more freedom of approach than the latest installments. Particular missions take place on more extensive and open maps, which contrasts with relatively linear missions from Battlefield 3 and Battlefield 4, which took place in half-closed environments.\nThe realities of the First World War have their in-game representations in the forms of weaponry and vehicles, but the game recreates the specific fighting techniques used during that war as well. In Battlefield 1, combat is more brutal and particular encounters more personal, for a significantly greater emphasis was placed on melee combat - for instance, using shovels or bayonets. Apart from infantry encounters, for example, the game allows to take control over different planes (both fighters and bombers), different kinds of tanks, as well as warships. Importantly, controlling various machines comes with a great deal of diversity, for even within one type of vehicles, particular models handle differently, thus being able to control a lightweight tank does not guarantee the same performance while handling its heavier equivalent. Small vechicles known from previous games were substituted by horses, which is pretty original.Game modesAs usual, Battlefield 1 for PS4 offers an extensive story campaign and a set of multiplayer options. Contrary to most of the recent installments, Battlefield 1 brings the singleplayer and multiplayer modes together, thus the mechanics of particular story missions resemble the specifics of the multiplayer mode to a large extent. In the multiplayer mode, even up to 64 players are able to compete against each other in epic, online battles accounting for one of the most spectacular combat experiences in the history of the genre. Interestingly, the game features the so-called persistent squad system allowing the players to gather themselves in teams that are transferred from one battle or a server to another.Technical aspectsIn terms of technicalities, this installment utilizes the latest version of the acclaimed Frostbite engine as usual. As a result, the game offers substantially more interactive battlefields - to illustrate, a new damage system was implemented and destruction of environment has more influence on the course of action. The players are capable of destroying smaller and bigger vehicles, as well as entire buildings - from wooden chalets to huge forts made of stone. Because it is the first installment in the series to be created only for modern-day PCs and consoles belonging to the eighth generation of hardware, the game is a large step forward in terms of the quality of graphics, standing way ahead of Battlefield 4 - a game released three years earlier.", "Expected_Rating": "7.0", "Current_Rating": "8.33"}, {"Title": "The Walking Dead: The Final Season", "Tags": ["Adventure", "TPP", "zombie", "Post Apocalypse", "comics", "episodic"], "Developer": "Telltale Games / Still Not Bitten", "Publisher": "Telltale Games", "Mode": "single player", "Release_Date_Day": "14", "Release_Date_Month": "August", "Release_Date_Year": "2018", "Game_Description": "The Walking Dead: A Telltale Games Series - The Final Season is the last entry in the series of adventure games started in 2012 by Telltale Games (the creators of Batman: The Telltale Series, The Wolf Among Us: A Telltale Games Series, and many other games). Contrary to the previous entry in the series titled A New Frontier, in which one of the main playable characters was Javier Garcia, this time the developers focused mostly on Clementine. She debuted in the first entry in the series as a small girl and the final season will present the end of her adventure in the world filled by zombies. Telltale Games is traditionally publishing the game in episodes. The Walking Dead series is based on comics written by Robert Kirkman.PlotThe Final Season takes place a few years after the events depicted in A New Frontier. Clementine is the main protagonist of the story. The boy named AJ returns as well \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Clementine is taking care of him.

The protagonists are looking for shelter in an abandoned school, where, as usual for the series, they must face hordes of zombies and desperate/amoral people. Together with Clementine, the players must make many hard decisions.MechanicsThe game uses mechanics known from The Walking Dead series and the majority of episodic adventure games developed by Telltale Games, but it also adds some small improvements. The gameplay is focused on exploration and numerous conversations with non-playable characters. It lacks classic logic puzzles. Instead, a great emphasis was placed on the necessity to frequently make moral choices that can shape the story of the game. The title also features occasional action sequences. Contrary to previous games, this time they aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t presented as QTE sequences. Instead, the sequences aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t scripted anymore.

The game features a completely new camera system. The camera is placed low above the shoulder of the character.

The main protagonist of the first season of The Walking Dead is Lee Everett. The story begins at the outbreak of zombie apocalypse, at the time when Rick Grimes (the protagonist of the comic) is in a coma.

The second installment was also created by Ubisoft's internal studios led by Ubisoft Montreal - the team behind production of such popular franchises as Far Cry, Assassin's Creed, Prince of Persia, Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell or the most recent installments in the Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six series.\nPlot\nIn contrast to the seriousness and gloomy atmosphere of the first installment, Watch Dogs 2 delivers the player with a more relaxed approach to the formula of a hacking-themed open-world game.

The creators were focused on giving more freedom of approach to the player, who can complete subsequent story missions in a variety of ways, depending on their preferences (for instance, sneaking or neutralizing enemies in open combat). Both the driving physics and the way the protagonist moves were improved. In the latter case, it is worth mentioning that Marcus Holloway is a skilled freerunning practicioner.\nGame modes\nIn Watch Dogs 2 for PC, PS4 and XONE, the key feature is obviously an extensive, single-player campaign offering a wide set of side-activities apart from story-based missions. Nonetheless, the game does not lack a multiplayer experience, which is integrated with the solo mode, in accordance with the latest trends. Thanks to this, the player is constantly connected with their friends, even when enjoying the story mode.

Because InXile does not possess rights to the Planescape brand, the company decided to set Torment's spiritual successor in another world.

The general is doing whatever he can to kill everyone who comes from Arcs \u00e2\u0080\u0093 special vaults in which selected individuals could survive the apocalypse. The players assume the role of Walker \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the last Guardian from Vineland. He is trying to stop Cross\u00e2\u0080\u0099 plans from realization.MechanicsRAGE 2 features a vast, open world that consists of deserts known from the previous game, remains of an old civilization, post-apocalyptic cities and settlements, swamps, and jungles. Like in the first RAGE, the map can be traversed on foot or by using various vehicles.In addition to exploration, the gameplay features elimination of hordes of enemies with a variety of guns. The players can modify their weapons in order to increase their combat potential. Walker can also use special skills provided by implants called the Nanotrites. They enable the protagonist to perform deadly attacks like a ground hit or an energy surge that throws away all nearby adversaries. As the players progress through the game, the protagonist learns how to implement the implants into weapons \u00e2\u0080\u0093 after filling a special bar and activating the Overdrive mode the weapon is dealing more damage, it gains new parameters and Walker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health begins to regenerate.Technical aspectsContrary to the first RAGE, RAGE 2 is powered by Apex technology \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the same engine that was used in previous games developed by Avalanche Studios.

One day an old friend of the family contacts her,  who believes her memories can be the key to catching the murderer.

According to the Firaxis' vision of the story, these efforts failed, resulting in alien invaders enslaving humanity under a cover of interracial cooperation. Yet, hope for freedom has not died yet, as there are still some people who will not accept these pitiful conditions. The remnants of the paramilitary XCOM organization operate in secret, and apply guerrilla combat in order to reclaim control over the planet.\nMechanics\nJust as in the first game, gameplay is twofold: strategic layer is about managing the development of your base and military technologies in real time, whereas direct combat with aliens is turn-based. XCOM organization, which you become the head of, has limited resources at its disposal and has to operate in shadows. The player\u00e2\u0080\u0099s duty is to expand the resistance and let the public know the real intents of the aliens.

The composition of your team and their equipment depends on your choices. Players get a wide array of technologies and gears, which they can modify as they see fit. XCOM 2 expands on the system of procedurally generated maps (layout and enemies), which eliminates repetitiveness of locations.

Contrary to its predecessors, most of the development process was carried out by an outside team of 60 people led by Steve Hart, who previously worked on such titles as Sniper Elite V2 (by Rebellion), and Paul Robinson, the co-creator of Killzone 2, Full Spectrum Warrior, Comanche, and Armored Fist, among other things.\nStory\nThe story takes place during the emergence of Cold War between Russia and the United States. Kremlin-supported separatists were ordered to destabilize the Georgia region, whose strategical importance was previously considered negligible. We assume the role of a retired USMC sniper, Jonathan North, whose task is the efficient and silent elimination of key targets, as well as a personal mission connected to his younger brother who disappeared in the aforementioned area. Parachuted behind enemy lines, the protagonist will have to decide whom to cooperate with, and whom to oppose.\nGameplay\nIn contrast with the previous installments in the series, Ghost Warrior 3 puts a much greater emphasis on freedom of action. In the game world, apart from the main storyline, there are tons of side quests available, and it is entirely up to us to decide their importance and when, if ever, we feel like undertaking them. While playing, we traverse vast wildland areas, negotiate with conflicted sides, and eliminate people who are key to the plot development. Traditionally, we employ a wide arsenal of faithfully recreated sniper rifles and cutting-edge military hardware, such as drones that can be used not only to scout ahead, but also to disarm land mines or hack cameras. At the same time, the gameplay features numerous survival elements. During some missions, we will have to use the crafting system to upgrade weapons, traps, or ammunition. In many cases, proper reconnaissance and setting an ambush or a sniper position in the right place will be just as important as accurate shoots.The freedom of action allows us to eliminate our targets in many different ways. As befits a sniper game, the discrete methods are the most effective ones. According to the \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou cannot kill what you cannot see\u00e2\u0080\u009d principle, the most profitable approach involves stealthily in sneaking behind our enemies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 back and eliminating our targets in a way that does not raise suspicion. Traditionally, one of the most important elements of the gameplay is the incredibly advanced recreation of bullet trajectories. The success of each shot depends on numerous factors, such as distance, wind speed, temperature, or even air humidity. Given the fact that the ammunition is difficult to obtain on enemy territory, every bullet is precious and must be fired minimizing the risk of failure. Furthermore, big maps allow us to drive vehicles in order to move faster.\nTechnology\nSniper: Ghost Warrior 3 for PC, PS4 and XONE is powered by the advanced CryEngine, which translates into significant improved graphics.

As befits a Battle Royale game, PUBG delivers matches, in which a large group of players is thrown right in the middle of a large map with one objective \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to survive longer than the other players and eliminate all the opponents. An additional difficulty lies in a continuously shrinking area \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a player has to be inside an electric barrier limiting the battlefield; otherwise, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re as good as dead.Players\u00e2\u0080\u0099 characters are transported over the battlefield with an airplane.

Upon landing, one can select between first-person and third-person perspectives. Then, players have to set off to explore the abandoned and devastated post-communist buildings in order to acquire weapons, armor, and other pieces of gear that might provide a tactical advantage over the enemies. Some of the items, such as backpacks and bulletproof vests, have three levels of quality that ensure various statistics for the character. Moreover, players can modify their weapons with multiple upgrades, e.g. extended clips, silencers, buttstocks, ammunition bags, special gun-sights, and many more. Each upgrade changes weapon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s parameters and significantly influences the gameplay. The key to success lies in the utilization of proper tactics allowing a player to eliminate the largest number of his opponents and surviving for as long as possible.\nAdditionally, players get at their disposal different vehicles that facilitate the movement around the vast maps \u00e2\u0080\u0093 one can drive an off-road vehicle, a sedan, a modern buggy-type vehicle, as well as a motorcycle. Each vehicle requires fuel \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a player has to tend to it before each ride.\nWhen traversing the map, a player can utilize a clear map and use markers for planning the tactics. As a result of continuous effort and inevitable gunfights, one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character is bound to lose his energy and health shown in two separate bars in the interface. In order to regain the lost portion of health, a player can reach for energy drinks, painkillers, medkits, and many other first-aid items.\nFor each match, a player is awarded a certain amount of points, which can be increased for each kill, damage, and ranking score. These points can be spent on crates with random pieces of gear as well as weapons\u00e2\u0080\u0099 modifications, additional pieces of equipment, and modification of character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s appearance (this regards character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sex, face, and hairstyle).Game modesThe PC and XONE release of PlayerUnknown\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Battlegrounds offers multiplayer modes only \u00e2\u0080\u0093 up to 100 players can play simultaneously in one match. Nonetheless, one can choose if he wants to enter the battle alone or in a team of two or four. When playing in a team, player\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character does not die upon losing all his health points \u00e2\u0080\u0093 he falls to the ground and has to crawl to the nearest ally before a new bar that is activated disappears. A player has a limited amount of time to find someone who will give him a new lease of life.Technical aspectsUnlike his previous projects, Green has decided to base the PC and XONE release of PlayerUnknown\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Battlegrounds on the technology offered by Unreal Engine 4; nonetheless, the number of modifications implemented into the engine makes the game much different from similar productions using the same technology developed by Epic.

In the game we assume the role of the eponymous Max, who after losing his legendary V8 Interceptor vehicle sets off on a journey through the vast, post-apocalyptic wasteland. The purpose of his journey is to construct a new machine, which equals the performances of its legendary predecessor. However, this is only an introduction to the many adventures awaiting on the way of the protagonist.

A new machine called the Magnum Opus, which you can improve as you progress in the game, will help is in the exploration. As a result, we improve both the performance and combat efficiency which is particularly important because it is the vehicle that will be our primary weapon. The developers put a considerable emphasis on the element of vehicle battles, and also created about 50 different vehicles known from the film series.In situations where we will not be able to count on the support of our vehicle, Max is forced to fight his enemies in the old-fashioned way. Our arsenal will include various types of firearms. However, since it is quite difficult to obtain ammunition in the wasteland, the most reliable weapon are often Max\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fists.

PlotMost Warhammer 40,000 licensed games focus on one of the many conflicts between the intelligent races of the 41st  millennium and the fight against the forces of Chaos.  However, Necromunda: Hired Gun is based on a side game from this universe, set on the titular planet.  Although it is part of the Imperium of Man, we will not find here the glory of fighting for the Emperor, but the criminal underworld of the slums of the city-cop ruled by brutal gangs.  We take on the role of one of many mercenaries earning a living by carrying out a variety of tasks, mostly boiling down to eliminating the inhabitants of this dystopia.MechanicsThe player character is not a silent assassin by any means.  Equipped with a grappling hook, a wealth of (often explosive) weaponry and a host of cybernetic upgrades, and supported by a deadly dog, the protagonist is mobile and reluctant to eliminate targets discreetly.  As a result, the gameplay has a lot in common with the Doom series: the player must constantly be on the move, running up walls, jumping all over the place and constantly attacking the numerous enemies, be they lowly thugs and mutants or more powerful enemies.

It was developed by the French studio Arkane, the creators of Dark Messiah of Might & Magic, and published by Bethesda Softworks, the owner of such franchises as The Elder Scrolls and Fallout. Dishonored 2 came out for personal computers as well as the 8th-generation consoles.StoryThe action of Dishonored 2 takes place 15 years after the events of the first installment of the series.

Upon their arrival at Karnaca, the protagonists start to look for ways to restore the throne to the rightful empress.GameplayIn the prologue, we assume the role of Emily, but having completed the interactive introduction, we have to choose between the young empress and the protagonist of the first Dishonored, Corvo Attano. Although the story is hardly affected by this choice, because the differences are rather cosmetic, the decision is somewhat important, as the selected hero or heroine cannot be switched, unless we start a new game. The playthroughs are different for each character, though, mainly because of the unique sets of available magical powers and different dialogue lines (yes, Corvo finally learned how to speak).The gameplay formula remained largely unchanged. In Dishonored 2, we still make progress by completing quests. Their structure somewhat resembles that of the Hitman series. We are given various tasks, often involving assassinations, but the way we complete them is entirely for us to choose. We have a lot of freedom in deciding how to approach the objective \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we determine the path we take to our target, deal with the guards as we see fit (we can kill them in open combat, murder them in silence, knock them out, avoid them, etc.), look for additional information, complete optional objectives and so on.\nInstead of trying to revolutionize the solutions of the well-received Dishonored, the developers decided to merely enhance the already known mechanisms.

The chaos system, responsible for moral evaluation of the player\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions, was also improved, and now monitors our deeds more precisely, providing a wider range of consequences to our choices (it primarily applies to developing the story in various directions). What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more, the character development was expanded, allowing the players to personalize their preferred play style even further.Game modesSimilarly to the first Dishonored, Dishonored 2 offers only a single player mode.

After the infamous incident with biochips that made augmented people attack everyone on sight, societies divided into supporters and adversaries of augmentations.

The developers let the players play in two basic ways: one is focused on action and open combat, while the other rewards sneaking, infiltration and silent elimination of our enemies. Foes are now much more dangerous thanks to the enhanced artificial intelligence and the ability to work in groups. Seldom do we encounter a situation when guards are on their own \u00e2\u0080\u0093 this time around, they move at least in pairs, even when patrolling nooks and crannies. Moreover, the developers made sure our opponents are significantly more diverse, and thus we will face adversaries that use augmentations and exoskeletons as well as mechs. Much attention was given to improving the boss fights. These can now be played in various ways, including stealthy surprise attacks, full frontal assaults or a combination of both.\nAdam Jensen gained a number of completely new skills. Augmentations in Mankind Divided are about twice as numerous as in Human Revolution. The protagonist can now hack turrets, robots and cameras remotely; he may also execute nearly instant jumps on short distances. The blade on his forearm might be used for direct melee attacks or to shot lesser projectiles. There is also an augmentation that incapacitates our enemies with electricity. As we progress, we unlock access to new skills that will be of use during combat, sneaking or both. However, using them uses up our energy reserves. Although they partially replenish themselves when Jensen is not using his enhancements, their complete regeneration requires special biocells.\nDepending on our choices, the game can take unexpected turns in the long run. For instance: at the beginning, we bump into some criminals, and if we choose to cross them, we can later fall victim to their revenge. It is not everything, though \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the events of Mankind Divided are also influenced by conversations we have with other characters, which allows us to resolve some conflicts with diplomacy alone (this is where C.A.S.I.E, the implant that analyzes the psychological state of our interlocutor, comes in handy).\nTechnology\nAs the first installment of the series created solely for the 8th-generation platforms, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided for PS4 is powered by an entirely new graphic engine called Dawn Engine.

The game has been developed by the German studio KING Art, which has, among other things, warmly welcomed The Book of Unwritten Tales 2 and the adventure game The Raven: Legacy of a Master Thief. The publisher of this game is Deep Silver.Plot\nThe action of Iron Harvest takes place in the universe 1920, created by Jakub Rozalski. This is an alternative vision of reality, in which mechs could be found on the fronts of World War I, and after the end of the global conflict powerful machines fitted into human everyday life, becoming an integral part of the landscape. Europe was divided into three powers, constantly fighting for influence: the Saxony Empire, Polanian Republic and Rusviet, modelled on Germany, Poland and Russia respectively. While the Saxony Empire capitulated during the Great War and is now trying to regain its former position, the Polanian Republic, based on agriculture, is trying to maintain the status quo at all costs, while at the same time conducting extensive modernization of the army. The third and the biggest one is struggling with internal problems - Tsar Nikolai's strength is weakening, and Grigori Rasputin, who is planning to carry out a revolution, is applying for his legacy.The game tells the story of an attempt to provoke another great conflict in Europe, behind which stand unknown, mysterious forces. We get to know the story during three campaigns, separate for each country. In each case we lead a different hero and his animal companion: Anna and her bear Wojtek, Gunter with wolves named Nacht and Tag, and Olga and a tiger named Changa.MechanicsThe inspiration for the developers of Iron Harvest were, among others, Company of Heroes and Men of War. It is a real time strategy, in which the focus is primarily put on tactical military actions - the expansion of the base plays a secondary role here, and the key is to lead the units (the right position, selection of appropriate targets, etc.).\nThere are several dozens of different troops at the player's disposal - we have both infantry and a wide range of the previously mentioned mechs. Moreover, each faction has its own heroes, giving more strategic possibilities (some of them are also accompanied by animals that help in battle).\nAn interesting idea is the mechanics of reserves - before starting a given mission, we can choose several reserve units, which we will be able to unlock by spending certain resources during the game. This adds strategic depth to the game - the player is forced to make some important decisions before the actual gameplay starts.\nThe gameplay takes place on vast, open maps; an appropriate strategy not only provides for the use of guards, but also takes into account the fact that the environment is susceptible to destruction - the troops we control must therefore be in constant motion.Game modes\nIron Harvest offers three campaigns for a single player - one per faction. In total, the developers have prepared more than 20 missions, which can be completed both alone and in cooperation (the players then control half of the army).\nWe also have skirmishes with artificial intelligence (which can also be played in cooperation with another person), scenarios with special challenges and a multiplayer mode where we face other people.Technical aspectsIron Harvest is characterized by an original style, inspired by the reality of the interwar period.

The action takes place in 2020. You play as Recke, a member of the U.S. special unit called Tombstone. Other members of the unit: Sergeant Dunn, a guy called Irish, medic Pac and Ruger. Irish is voiced by Michael K. Williams, i.e. Omar Little in \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Wire\u00e2\u0080\u009d. The campaign takes you to the People\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Republic of China.

Due to some serious political friction between Russia, the United States and China, the task is not that easy and leads to a global conflict.The campaign includes several missions taking place in different locations.

The game was refreshed shortly after three of the four earlier installments in the series, Adventures of Mana, Secret of Mana and Trials of Mana.Plot\nAs a typical high fantasy game, Legend of Mana takes us to a universe full of magic and monsters.  However, at the start, the world of Fa'Diel is almost empty due to a cataclysm that took place nine centuries earlier.  It was then that the Mana Tree, the source of life and magical energy, was almost burnt to the ground.   A war broke out between the inhabitants of Fa'Diel, which eventually led to many lands being sealed in ancient artefacts.  The task of the player-led hero or heroine is to restore the Mana Tree, the entire world and its magical energy to its former glory.MechanicsLike previous remasters of the Mana series, Legend of Mana is a top-down action RPG.  During the game, together with up to two companions, we explore locations where we encounter NPCs and monsters.  We defeat monsters in a fight, in which we use magic and weaponry, in case of weapons we also use their special attacks called Special Techs.  From time to time we also encounter powerful bosses, and with the progress of the game we gain experience and develop the hero's abilities.The biggest new feature introduced in Legend of Mana is the Land Make system.  When we start the adventure, most of the map is literally empty.  To change this, we have to find artifacts in which old lands were sealed.  Then we place them in the chosen location to make a city, dungeon or other location appear there.  These differ not only in design, but also in the monsters and objects present in them.  These locations also describe the  Mana Levels for each of the eight types of magic assigned to mythical creatures such as jinn, ogres, salamanders or gnomes. The higher the mana level, the more effective the spells are during clashes in the area.  All this can also change depending on the artifacts neighbouring a particular location.Game modes\nLegend of Mana remaster is not just the story campaign, which can be played solo or in co-op with a friend.  With the game's debut, western gamers can finally check out the Ring  Ring Land mini-game.  Originally only available in Japan and requiring a  PocketStation accessory, it functions along similar lines to the iconic  Tamagochi.  So the player takes care of a pet, allowing the pet to gain  experience and the hero to gain items, which can then be uploaded to the  main game.Technical aspects and otherUnlike Trials of Mana, the refreshed Legend of Mana did not abandon the 2D graphic design.  Stylistically, the graphics do not differ from that of the original release, but the developers took care to adapt it to modern standards.  So the game works in much higher resolutions, and the whole thing looks decent.

The franchise is considered the spiritual heir to the classic Colin McRae Rally series. DiRT 4 delivers an extension to the concepts its predecessors were based on, but also introduces many novelties.MechanicsThe game offers over 50 cars and the player participates in several kinds of championships. Rallying takes place mainly in Sweden, Michigan, Wales, Spain and Australia. During the in-game events, the player drives in such classic cars as Audi Sport Quattro S1 E2 or the legendary Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VI, but the game also features newer vehicles, most notably Ford Fiesta R5. Furthermore, the player will find the Landrush mode, which returns in this installment, giving an opportunity to drive lightweight and very maneuverable vehicles (Pro Buggy, the Pro-2 and Pro-4 class trucks, crosskarts) when competing for victory in Nevada, Mexico and California. The largest novelty introduced however, is the FIA World Rallycross Championship license, which brings a competition variant dedicated specifically for rallycross events \u00e2\u0080\u0093 here, the player takes part in direct competition on tracks located in Lydden Hill, Montalegre, Hell, Holjes and Loh\u00c3\u00a9ac Bretagne. What complements the set of gameplay variants available, is the Joyride mode, which offers different kinds of challenges, such as time trials or those requiring the player to destroy objects for instance.DiRT 4 for PC, PS4 and XONE borrows plenty of gameplay elements from both the installments that focused on arcade rivalry, and the realism-driven DiRT Rally. As a result, DiRT 4 features an advanced damage system \u00e2\u0080\u0093 both visual and mechanical. If the player seriously damages their car, the engineers are the only ones that can help after the finished run. The better (more expensive option) specialists the player hires, the more effective they are at preparing the car for another start. Thus it is worth keeping in mind that between particular sections of a rally, the player has a limited amount of time that can be spent on repairing the car. Also, the game offers a wide set of tuning options - the car setup can be adjusted to the player's individual preferences or simply automatically matched with the conditions on the road.Game modesThe game brings different modes for the player to enjoy, the most basic of which is the Career - the player creates their own driver here; alongside progression, one builds up their team (consisting of more and more effective specialists) and attracts subsequent sponsors. Apart from that, DiRT 4 comes with a competition-based multiplayer mode complemented by daily, weekly and monthly challenges. The multiplayer is supervised by the RaceNet service, which makes it possible to organize on-line leagues and tournaments. This system also manages the online rankings, where the players can share their results with others.\nMoreover, the creators implemented a special module called Your Stage \u00e2\u0080\u0093 this allows the player to create their own routes in a simple and intuitive manner. The players can share their creations with other contestants and even compete for the best result.Technical aspectsDiRT 4 for PC, PS4 and XONE utilizes the Ego technology, which was used in production of the previous installments as well. However, the engine went through certain modifications, which made it possible to benefit from the capabilities of modern-day PCs and consoles.

The main objective is to fit into a group of contemporaries and make as many friends as possible. On the way to achieving these ambitions, a large number of crazy adventures and challenges await him. The plot is made of absurd humor well-known from the TV series. What is interesting, this is the first game in production of which the actual creators of the series \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Matt Stone and Trey Parker \u00e2\u0080\u0093 took part. It is they who are responsible for the scenario, dialogues, and the dubbing of some characters.The adventure begins with creating a character. There are four character classes: Sorcerer, Warrior, Thief, and Jew. The gameplay is about exploring the town, speaking with other characters, and performing the tasks given. The combat system is based on turn-based mechanics, reminiscent of the early Final Fantasy games. During the fights, the player character and one additional character face up to 6 enemies. We see the fight from the side.In the game, there is a whole bunch of weapons that can be upgraded with special magical stickers. To heal a character, we drink soda, and the famous coffee that Tweek drinks is used to accelerate the character, which guarantees two attacks in one turn.

The entire interface is modeled on Facebook \u00e2\u0080\u0093 our friends post on our wall, we browse equipment and the collections there (in the game you can collect Chinpokomons, among others).The story of South Park: The Stick of Truth begins with joining Cartman and his team to take part in a rather aggressive LARP, which is a role playing game session in which not only we play a character verbally, but also we dress like it, and take physical actions. Normally, the LARP rule is: do not touch, which means in a nutshell: If you attack someone, do not hit him on the head with a dummy sword. In South Park, this rule does not apply. In the LARP invented by the kids from the town, the player character assumes the role of a representative of the human race, while Stan and Kyle are elves who search for the very powerful eponymous artifact. What starts as a rather innocent war-game, turns quickly into something much more absurd and having far more serious consequences for the entire town.In the Stick of Truth the immersion is almost complete. To outsiders it is difficult to tell at a fist glance if they are dealing with a game or another episode of South Park.

The authors give us three characters  differentiated by their skills and the story that led them to this  place. MechanicsIn Insurmountable we observe the action from third person  perspective (TPP).  Before setting off, we have to take a look at the  mountain we are going to climb and determine the optimal route to its  top.  What complicates matters is that if we die on the way, we have no  choice but to start the expedition all over again.  As the peaks are  procedurally generated, each climb looks different and requires facing  different challenges. During the journey we have to lead the hero through fields of ice blocks and huge stones or overcome vertical rock walls.  As if that wasn't enough, along the way the weather and the merciless passage of time may turn out to be not very kind to him (the game features variable weather conditions and a daily cycle), and even wild, aggressive and hungry animals.  In addition, death on the route can bring the protagonist both lack of oxygen, hypothermia, fatigue or hunger or thirst (so you must constantly pay attention to the values of these factors), as well as a fall from a great height.  In addition, during the climbing we take part in hundreds of random events, and although only some of them are connected with danger, we have to make decisions carefully, so as not to make a choice that in the long run will bring us problems.\nFortunately, in the high mountains not everything wants to kill us.  Suffice it to say that along the way we can find remnants of previous expeditions, in which we often find useful equipment.  In addition, as we progress, we develop our character and unlock new skills that make climbing easier.Technical aspectsGraphics of Insurmountable looks decent.

It introduced a new location, i.e. enchanted forest Sharandar you explore with the help of Sun or Moon elves. Moreover, new weapons, items, rewards and enemies were offered.Neverwinter MMORPG focuses on the cooperative aspect. The game created by Cryptic, a studio mainly known of \u00e2\u0080\u009cCity of Heroes\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cChampions Online\u00e2\u0080\u009d, is based on the 4th edition of Dungeons & Dragons. The game takes place in a universe created for the purpose of the original Forgotten Realms setting, in Neverwinter, one hundred years after a magic plague completely changed the entire continent. The old empires were lost, most of the cities ruined or ruled by the hordes of monsters of all kinds. Neverwinter survived the cataclysm. Peace lasted for 75 years, until the eruption of a nearby volcano. The disaster devastated the whole city while in one of its districts a crack in a ground appeared through which dark creatures came in. Moreover, during the events more common creatures such as kobolds entered the city. When the game starts the situation in Neverwinter is rather stable due to the intervention of Lord Neverember of Waterdeep. He arrived with his army to help the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s citizens and appointed himself Lord Protector of the city. He calls all the adventurers and heroes to help him rebuild the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s former glory (and get its crown eventually). Nevertheless, dark forces plan to thwart his dream.Neverwinter does not offer one large virtual world; it is a mix of MMO elements and more traditional action-RPG online-oriented cooperation. Safe areas of the city are open to all players. You can find there guild halls, shops and banks, while hundreds of players wander around the streets. However, the adventure is instantiated. Individual quests are similar to those known from traditional RPG titles and they offer combat, exploration, side quests and expanded storyline. Group must always include five heroes and if there are no real players, AI comes in. When creating their characters, players are offered five classes to choose from (Warrior, Wizard, Rogue, Cleric and Hunter) and classic genre races such as humans, elves and dwarves. The developers offer complex system for appearance customization so that everyone can create their virtual alter ego. Combat system is based on the principles of the original paper with statistics and skills playing the main role. At the same time, the combat includes action elements. Therefore, maneuvering on the battlefield is not that easy, in particular without automatic attack. You need to fire up each blow and spell manually and avoid being hit if you wish to stay alive. Not to mention that you must search for a position that gives you a tactical advantage.Another feature is powerful and yet easy to use tool for creating your own adventures. The editor does not resemble typical modder tool as it is much simpler and its use does not require any programming skills.

The brand began life in 2002 with the premiere of Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven from Illusion Softworks, which quickly gained cult status. We had to wait until 2010 for sequel, and six years later the third part of the cycle debuted produced by Hangar 13. The studio - with the creators of the previous games in the series - is also responsible for modernising the entire trilogy for the eighth generation consoles, including refreshing the audiovisual setting.Plot\n\nEach of the three games in the Mafia: Trilogy tells a separate story. The subsequent parts of the series contain references to the previous ones, but they are not linked by a place, not by the main character's person.Mafia: Definitive Edition takes place in the 1930s. and tells the story of Thomas Angelo. An ordinary taxi driver in the town of Lost Heaven gets tangled up in a gang rivalry and starts his criminal career in the Salieri family.\nMafia II: Definitive Edition takes us back to the times after World War II and to the city of Empire Bay, to which Vito Scaletta returns after his military service. The protagonist does not like hard work for a lousy salary, especially since his father left his family with big debts. To pay them off, Vito decides to become a gangster working for one of the influential mafias ruling the city.\nMafia III: Definitive Edition takes us back to the times after another armed conflict. John Lincoln returns from the Vietnam War in 1968. However, he is not allowed to rest - his little group of criminals is betrayed and he barely gets away with life. Now John only wants one thing - revenge. But it won't be easy, because among the people responsible for the murder of his relatives is the boss of the influential Italian mafia. Before John can carry out his plans, he will have to consolidate his position in the criminal underworld of New Bordeaux.MechanicsThe game that make up the Mafia: Trilogy set are slightly different in terms of gameplay, but their basic assumptions remain the same. All three are TPP action games with an open world, in which we go to a huge city and perform various missions. Some of them allow us to push the plot forward, presented mainly as non-interactive scenes. However, like other sandboxes like the Grand Theft Auto series, there are a lot of side activities in addition to the main tasks. During the game we have the opportunity to show off all mafia-related activities such as extortion, fights with rival groups and police chases.\nAn important element of the series is the need to comply with the law, taking into account road regulations. Imprudent driving through a red light or pushing too much gas will bring serious trouble to our heads, which in the case of more serious offences (for example, walking with a gun) may cause us serious trouble.Game modes\n\nNone of the games in the Mafia: Trilogy offer multiplayer or co-op mode.Technical aspects\nThe second and third part of the cycle has been only slightly refreshed. For the remaster of the second part, 4K resolution support and a handful of graphical options not present in the original have also been added. It's different with the Mafia: Definitive Edition.

Although it is the first project of the Polish developer, some of the team members formerly worked on such acclaimed titles as The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt or Kholat. IMGN.PRO took care of the publishing, having already released American Truck Simulator and Spintires, among others.PlotSEVEN: The Days Long Gone for PC is set in the Empire of Vethrall \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a world power born from the ashes of an old civilization that took a large step backwards about a thousand years earlier, instead of developing further. However, the circumstances of this event remain misterious. The player is put in the shoes of Teriel \u00e2\u0080\u0093 both a henchman and a skilled thief taking different assignments. One of these quests brings the protagonist to the island of Peh, which is also a penal colony. A series of events the player participates in begins here.MechanicsThe game is an action-RPG played from an isometric view and set in a post-apocalyptic world. SEVEN stands out with an interesting game world, which resembles the medieval period in its stylistics, but also contains elements of advanced technologies - these are considered remnants of the old civilization. The protagonist himself is not a typical hero as well: during his journey, he is constantly accompanied by Artanak - a demon residing within the character. As a result, Teriel gains access to a set of unique abilities based on the senses of the being concealed within the protagonist. Thus Teriel is able to know a guard's range of sight. He is also capable to slow down or accelerate the passage of time, for instance.Teriel is a thief, thus the game does not feature any division into character classes - the protagonist can develop in one single way. Obviously, it affects the gameplay itself, resulting in a stealth-action experience in many aspects. The player moves across rooftops silently, sneaking past guards and wearing different disguises. When necessary, attacking by surprise is also an option. It is not an easy game however, for both the game world and its inhabitants are subjects to changing weather conditions and a time cycle. For example, when it rains, water pools appear on the ground. Stepping into one makes a noise which can alert the nearby guards.\nContrary to other games belonging to the genre, SEVEN offers open, multi-leveled locations and an environment reflecting the player's actions. The developer gives a set of abilities to the players - using these for different purposes is entirely up to them. The in-game levels were divided into zones and the player is capable of travelling from one to another freely, as long as they have a visa - it can be stolen or acquired during a mission. Without the visa, the player is required to face numerous difficulties, such as having to avoid guards for example. Apart from that, the players can try different tricks, losing a group of enemies who chase the protagonist in crowds of citizens who may not be happy about seeing the guards running around their neighborhoods. All of this means that particular quests can be approached in multiple ways.Technical aspectsSEVEN: The Days Long Gone for PC stands out particularly with its level design.

The game began in 2018 under the name Dungeonhaven as a project of three developers who worked on, among others, the Call of Duty series and Ghost of Tsushima.Plot\n\nMortal Shell action is set in a fantasy universe. However, this is not a colourful land of elves or dwarves, but a dark world world filled with horror, where only ruins and fragile memories remain of human civilisation. The mysterious existence known as the Dark Father does not like it. He is the one who gives orders to the main character - an empty vessel without form - to go in search of the lost shrines of the faithful, where he will have to cope with enormous challenges.MechanicsMortal Shell uses the classic soulslike scheme. We observe the action from the third person perspective (TPP). The fight is very skillful, but there is no question of chaotic pushing buttons or joyful sword waving (or other cold weapon) like in typical slashers. Every enemy is a threat to us, and often we are forced to face several opponents at once. Good reflex is not enough to come out of these fights victoriously. It is also necessary to conduct the fight carefully and to keep a sense, so that a too hasty attack is not the last one.What makes Mortal Shell different from other games is an unusual system of development of the character. The character we lead has no body, but instead takes control of dead warriors. Each of them during their lifetime was unique in their abilities and specialization, which we can use after taking over their bodies. As the hero deepens his understanding of a certain body, further abilities and upgrades are unlocked, making him even more dangerous in battle. We receive both a large arsenal of weapons and a large number of offensive spells.Game modes\n\nMortal Shell is designed for the single player adventure. There is no multiplayer here. The story campaign is non-linear in nature, giving us the freedom to choose our next goal.Technical aspects\nMortal Shell graphics brings to mind other soulslike games, but it is closest to the style known for From Software studio games.

Curiously, the PC Windows edition is free for everyone who bought the original Skyrim and all the DLC packs or own the Legendary Edition.PlotThe plot of The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim Special Edition takes place 200 years after the events of Oblivion. You play as one of the last Dovahkiin, dragon hunters. Until recently, it was thought that the powerful beasts were long since extinct, but one day they appear in the skies again, and a prophecy foretells the coming of Alduin, the god of destruction, who takes on the form of a dragon. When fighting dragons, you absorb their souls and abilities, the so-called Shouts. Thanks to them, you can slow time, push back your foes with the use of an invisible energy, and even call an allied dragon to help you. Many such abilities are unlocked by finding ancient words located in Nordic underground ruins.MechanicsYou start the game of The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim Special Edition for PC, PS4 and etc. by creating your character. You can choose from ten varied races, and there are no specific classes. As the game progresses, your character grows more powerful.

The magic system has also been changes\u00e2\u0080\u0094the Mysticism school spells have been moved to other skill groups.Skyrim features a new, more dynamic combat system, which demands tactical thinking. Both hands of your character can now use weapons, shields, or spells. It enables you to create many combinations, e.g. combining an attack spell in one hand with a sword in the other. Direct combat can no longer by won by mindlessly mashing your keyboard\u00e2\u0080\u0094now you have to manoeuvre your character properly, dodge and parry blows, and stagger your enemies. You can also be easily staggered yourself, which makes you vulnerable to the attacks of your foes, who are now more dangerous and durable. Your character can also perform spectacular finishing moves.\nThe fifth instalment of The Elder Scrolls series once again wants you to feel as if you are traversing a real world, populated with real people. The consequences of your decisions are now more serious and linked to the more interesting behaviour of other characters. For example, if you drop a dagger in the middle of a city, someone may either return it to you or steal it. The dialogues have also been improved and now they feel much more natural. When you get bored of saving the world, you may take a break to do some more mundane tasks. The game allows you to gather crops, smith weapons in forges, cook, mine ores in mines, and even make armours.\nThe Elder Scrolls: Skyrim Special Edition allows you to traverse an enormous virtual world, in which you can visit e.g. five major cities and hundreds of dungeons. To make your journeys easier, the developers included the fast-travel option. The strength of your foes is again scaled up to your own, although it's been ensured that it would not be as invasive as it was in Oblivion. The game's upgraded engine selects the quests according to your achievements and level. For example, when a woman asks you to find her kidnapped daughter, the system checks which dungeons you have already visited, and places the girl in a place you've never been before, while at the same time adding enemies on a level high enough to still prove a challenge for you.", "Expected_Rating": "8.2", "Current_Rating": "8.31"}, {"Title": "eFootball PES 2021", "Tags": ["Sports", "Football", "for 2 people", "splitscreen", "Find Your Next Game"], "Developer": "Konami", "Publisher": "Konami", "Mode": "single player", "Release_Date_Day": "15", "Release_Date_Month": "September", "Release_Date_Year": "2020", "Game_Description": "eFootbal PES 2021 Season Update is the next instalment of the popular Konami football game series.

This place is visited by the greatest heroes from all over the world, who are trying to neutralize the threat from the hordes of goblins, undead, and animals tainted by the magic of the mineral known as Ember.MechanicsThe mechanics of Torchlight Frontiers expand on the solutions from the previous entries in the series. The game is a classic hack\u00e2\u0080\u0099n\u00e2\u0080\u0099slash action RPG in which the players are traveling through the world, collecting items, completing quests, developing character, and defeating hordes of enemies by using a very action-based combat system.These regular activities were enriched with MMO features. In Torchlight Frontiers, the world is shared between all players on the server. At the same time, a large part of this world \u00e2\u0080\u0093 dungeons and places where the adventures on the surface take place \u00e2\u0080\u0093 is randomly generated, always providing new challenges for the players.\nDespite the MMO features, the game is focused on cooperation adventures, in which groups of a few players are fighting with enemies controlled by artificial intelligence. A pet system makes the game more interesting, enabling the players to train their animals. These pets are helping the characters in combat. They can also perform many other useful actions. For example, they can go to the city and sell items.Technical aspectsThe game features attractive three-dimensional graphics that use the style similar to the one used in two previous entries in the series. The visuals are filled with light colors and the character designs are slightly grotesque.", "Expected_Rating": "6.3", "Current_Rating": "7.5"}, {"Title": "FIFA 19", "Tags": ["Sports", "Football", "adventure elements", "for 2 people", "splitscreen", "EA Play"], "Developer": "EA Sports", "Publisher": "Electronic Arts Inc.", "Mode": "single / multiplayer", "Release_Date_Day": "28", "Release_Date_Month": "September", "Release_Date_Year": "2018", "Game_Description": "Developed for a number of platforms, FIFA 19 is the next installment of the extremely popular series of football games, in which we have the ability to lead real teams and players. The production offers modes for a single player as well as for several people. EA Sports studio is responsible for creating the title, consistently developing the FIFA series since 1993.MechanicsFIFA 19 is a sports simulator. As in the previous versions of the series, players receive the opportunity to play matches and tournaments with licensed national and club teams from all over the world. A major change compared to last year's edition the license for the Champions League and the European League. Meetings are very realistic, resembling the struggles of real teams and players.The game has a complex but intuitive control system, which allows to perform a huge number of moves and tricks known from the world's stadiums. FIFA 19 introduces improved control over the ball and a completely new shooting system \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Timed Finishing. It makes it possible to press the shot button twice, and if we do it with the right feel, our hit has a much better chance of landing in the net. EA Sports has also implemented a second player indicator, which appears when we don't have the ball and shows which player - apart from the one controlled by us - will be pressing the opponent (this solution is very similar to the one used in the Pro Evolution Soccer series). Marking movement upon receiving ball has also been improved, just as camera movement in free kicks.\nOne of the biggest novelties in comparison to FIFA 18 is the much bigger role tactics play on the virtual pitch. We can, for example, assign zones to defenders and give them much more detailed instructions. We also have the ability to decide how wide you want to play and how intensive should exchanges of the ball be, as well as determine different strategies depending on the course of the game.Game modesFIFA 19 on each of the platforms can be played alone or with others. We have a career mode (where we can lead a single player or an entire team), another chapter of the plot \"The road to fame,\" and a wide range of multiplayer games. The FIFA Ultimate Team mode, known from previous editions of the series and based on collecting player cards, is also coming back. The modes with special rules are another addition - we can for example play a game in which only goals scored with the head or the volley count, or where one of the players leaves the field after each scored goal.Technical aspectsThis title again uses the power of the Frostbite engine, as well as Real Players Motion technology, thanks to which it is characterized by a highly realistic graphic design full of details.

The game was created and is being developed by the Japanese company Square Enix.  It is worth noting that A Realm Reborn is the second version of Final Fantasy XIV, prepared after the failure of the original release from 2010.  The developers put a lot of work into polishing the game and changed many of its concepts. In Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn we play as heroes who set off to rescue the continent of Eorzea, located in the world of Hydaelyn.  The land is recovering from a gigantic catastrophe caused by the summoning of Bahamut, an ancient being of great power. Eorzea has survived the cataclysm, but faces new problems - growing local conflicts and the threat of the Garlean Empire and other, more mysterious factions.  The power within the player characters will help to deal with these problems.  \nFinal Fantasy XIV is a typical MMORPG where players create characters and travel through a world filled with monsters, quests and items.  The game contains some interesting ideas, including dynamic Fate events, repetitive \"levequests\", or even a system of three large firms, within which you can advance to higher ranks. There were also group dungeons, instances and PvP modes.  In addition, players can become owners of their own headquarters, mount (Chocobo) or even a companion, who can be commissioned to sell items. \nWhen creating a hero, you can choose the gender and race.  The land of Eorzea is inhabited by the human Hyur, the elf-like Elezen, the small-sized Lalafell, the tall Roegadyn and the animal-like Miqo'te.  Each of the races has certain characteristics, although the abilities of a hero are determined mainly by the class - \"war\" (Gladiator, Pugilist, Marauder, Lancer, Archer) or \"magic\". (Conjurer, Thaumaturge, Arcanist).  Players can change classes freely and develop them simultaneously. This way, an Archer, for example, can use some of Conjurer's attacks or spells.  The freedom in class development also extends to the crafting and gathering professions.  Thus, a character can be an alchemist, a carpenter, a cook, a miner or a fisherman, among others. \nFinal Fantasy XIV stands out from other MMO games in that it is available on PC as well as PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4. What's more, players of all versions of the game share the same servers.  This means that it is possible to run the same character on both PC and console.  Unfortunately this requires purchasing a copy of Final Fantasy XIV for PC and PS3 or PS4.  The console legacy of the game resulted in the fact that \"fourteen\" can be played without any problems on a pad (also on PC).

The matches played in turns and each participating players has a limited amount of time to make his move.Similarly to the previous games, the available weapons are aplenty. Apart from standard ones such as a bazooka or an ordinary shotgun, there are also those less typical. Hostile worms can be attacked with, for instance, remote-controlled supersheep or exploding bananas, among other things. Of course, these are just examples of a myriad of gadgets that the pink earthworms have at their disposal.\nThe developers made sure they added a few novelties that refresh the tried gameplay formula. For the first time in the history of the series, worms can use vehicles to move around the battlefield. The players can, for example, drive a tank equipped with a cannon that deals massive damage. It is also possible to hide inside buildings on the map.Technical aspectsWorms WMD for PC, PS4 and etc. is powered by an in-house engine of Team17.

The characters they fight with are extremely skillful fighters with special abilities and they stand out significantly from the ordinary soldiers controlled by the AI; the player-controlled heroes are the ones who determine the outcome of the battle, showing up in key places of the skirmish and tipping the scales in the favor of their faction, unless they are confronted by a player (or multiple players) from the other faction, which is why swordplay is a fundamental part of the game.\nDespite a light-handed approach towards being historically correct, when it comes to the choice of factions, the devs have put a lot of effort towards making the fighting styles of knights, samurai and Vikings as realistic as possible. They have also designed a game mechanic called Art of Battle, which makes the side which you hold your weapon on extremely important, as e.g. you will not block a strike from your left side if you previously choose to parry to your right side. The special attacks are also worth mentioning, for spectacularly dispatching an enemy player we can call in e.g. a catapult barrage or temporarily increase the fighting ability of nearby soldiers.\nFor Honor for PC, PS4 and XONE also has a single player campaign, in which we are introduced to the world of the production.

This edition has been expanded with all the add-ons released so far, including DLC Kombat Pack 2, which adds to the game, among others, John Rambo. Mortal Kombat 11 was produced by NetherRealm Studios in cooperation with the Polish company QLOC. The complete edition of the game has also been released on PS5 and Xbox Series X with significant technical improvements. Plot\nMortal Kombat 11 offers a well-directed and cinematic story mode, which presents the future of the characters from Mortal Kombat X. The heroes meet their versions from the past as a result of the actions of the mysterious Chronicle. Everyone has to face it in order to prevent the story from being rewritten. The story is divided into chapters, and in each of them we direct a different character - although sometimes we can choose between one of the two characters taking part in a particular scene.In Mortal Kombat 11 Ultimate, players also have access to a story expansion (Mortal Kombat 11: Aftermath), which focuses on the fire god Liu Kang, who plays the role of time keeper and defender of the Earthrealm. The hero is forced to recruit two allies to help him face the imminent threat.MechanicsDuring the game in Mortal Kombat 11, we take part in duels held in various arenas. The dynamic fights are extremely bloody and their brutality is underlined by spectacular fatalities, i.e. special blows crowning the fight. The developers give us a wide range of warriors - apart from old friends like Raiden or Scorpion, you can also find completely new faces on the list. In addition, a special Custom Character Variations system has been implemented in the game, allowing individual fighters to be adjusted to each player's preferences.\nThe game is slightly slower than in the previous part of the series, and other changes have been introduced. X-Ray attacks have been replaced by Fatal Blow attacks, which can only be carried out if our character has few life points left. There are also Crushing Blows, activated automatically if specific conditions are met - for example, when Scorpion hits the enemy with a spear from the full length of the arena, or when we end the combo with a single, demanding special blow.Game modes\nApart from the story campaign, a lot of content was prepared for single player gameplay. The Klassic Towers with a number of challenges are back, as well as the Towers of Time, which diversifies the duels with different modifiers and external factors. These even allow you to fight against bosses, where three players fight one extremely strong enemy one after another. In the Towers of Time we win awards and items upgrades. All the equipment, which is worth mentioning, does not give an advantage in online gameplay. There is also The Crypt mode, where we visit the ruins and open more treasure boxes.\nIn online mode, we have ranking or regular duels - in the former we cannot use our own character variations. A tournament system has also been prepared, which allows for a convenient way of organising serious competition among friends.Technical aspectsThe original version of Mortal Kombat 11 runs on a heavily modified Unreal Engine 3, offering high quality graphics with striking punches, including  fatality. And for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S editions, NetherRealm Studio refreshed the engine by switching to Unreal Engine 4 and introducing rendering improvements in collaboration with the KoreTech development team. These versions boast a better graphic design (dynamic 4K resolution and overall graphics enhancements) and significantly reduced loading times.\nPlayStation 4 and Xbox One owners have received a free upgrade to next generation consoles. What's more, the game supports the cross-play function, which allows players from different hardware platforms to compete. However, cross-play does not apply to PC and Nintendo Switch users.\nMortal Kombat 11 Ultimate includes not only the main game, but also Kombat Pack 1 (includes 25 skins for characters and six new playable fighters: Shang Tsung, Nightwolf, Sindel, Joker, Terminator T-800 and Spawn), Kombat Pack 2 (includes Mileena, Rain and John Rambo with the voice and look of Sylvester Stallone, who was the main character in Rambo movies), and an expanded story expansion Mortal Kombat 11: Aftermath (adds a new theme about Liu Kang, 25 skins for the characters and three fighters: Fujin, Sheeva and RoboCop).

What makes it unique is that you can directly take part in spectacular medieval battles.

The world map includes all the locations from the base game and introduces a new faction (Sarranid Sultanate) and numerous side quests to complete.\nMultiplayer\nA key novelty is the brand new, expansive multiplayer for up to 64 players. TaleWorld prepared seven online modes. There is a classic Deathmatch, as well as its team-based variation. There are also Capture the Flag and Conquest. In the latter, the team controlling most of the locations marked by flags wins the game. Another mode is Siege. As its name suggests, one team has to defend a castle, while the other storms it. The stronghold falls if the attackers manage to take off the flag in the courtyard. First, though, they have to get there, which is made possible with ladders and siege towers. The last two modes are: Battle and Fight and Destroy. In these two, unlike the previous ones, there are no respawns, so you can't get back to the fight until a new round starts. Fight and Destroy again has two teams: attackers and defenders. This time, however, the latter have to defend two objects from destruction \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a catapult and a trebuchet.\nAnother key feature of the expansion are the visibly enhanced graphics.

It now has a structure that is more similar to the arcade racing game traditions (the player starts with free road cars and gradually moves on to more and more powerful machines) and is more friendly to newcomers. The game also offers a relatively wide range of possibilities for setting up the difficulty level and car assists - while maintaining realistic settings for veterans (however, the driving model has been somewhat simplified compared to Project CARS 2).In Career mode we get access to our own garage, which we gradually fill up with purchased cars. We use for that the currency we receive as we reach the next level of experience. The PC3 introduces the possibility of improving vehicles by purchasing parts that increase their performance index (similar to the Forza series). To a limited extent it is also possible to modify the appearance of cars (e.g. ready-made aerodynamic packages, wheels and license plates). In addition, a complex body painting editor has been created and a handful of driver personalisation options are available.\nProject CARS 3 also introduced a number of other important changes. Above all, the manufacturer has refreshed the gamepad steering model, giving a nod to the less advanced players, and has developed a new tyre simulation, improved artificial intelligence and increased the impression of speed while driving. The authors abandoned such elements as mechanical damage to cars, pre-race qualifications (in single player mode) and pit stops.\nTo the disposal of the players were given around 200 cars divided into ten classes and over 140 tracks (including brand new ones such as the Interlagos in Brazil's Sao Paolo or the streets of Shanghai), which can be seen in a full cycle of day and year seasons, in a wide range of weather conditions. Unfortunately, some of the content of Project CARS 2, headed by the famous Spa and Le Mans circuits and rallycross tracks and cars, were missing.Game modes\nProject CARS 3 allows you to play in both single and multi-player mode. The main game mode is Career (described above), which includes classic races, time trials and a new feature in the form of Demolition (smashing gates on time).

The title is a science fiction city builder \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it focuses on building and managing the first colony on Mars. The game was developed by Haemimont Games, a studio that created, among other games, Tropico 5. It was published by Paradox Interactive, a company that also released another city builder \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Cities: Skylines.During the production, the developers were inspired by cult science fiction works of authors like Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke and by the retrofuturism trend.MechanicsIn Surviving Mars for PC, PS4 and XONE the player is tasked with building a prospering colony on Mars. His tasks include taking care of matters that have direct impact on the success of the project: providing access to oxygen, to water, to food and to other resources required for the colonists to live and be happy; maintaining constant access to electricity; mining the required resources and improving knowledge, for example by organizing exploration trips into new areas of the planet and by conducting science experiments (that can lead to unpredictable situations).\nThe colonization begins with selecting a space agency that will provide financial support and resources for the operation. Then the player selects the best location for his future colony and he sends a non-human mission consisting of remote controlled vehicles and robots there. These mechanical astronauts are tasked with building the basic infrastructure to which the first humans can be sent. It is worth mentioning that the sponsor selected at the beginning has strong impact on later phases of the game: a profit-driven organization might want the colony to focus on mining valuable resources and on sending them to Earth while a more idealistic company might be easily angered by deaths of colonists.\nMaking the colony ready to accept first humans isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t simple \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it requires preparing various life support systems. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important, even after organizing energy and water sources, these systems can be damaged or deactivated by environmental factors. For example: in order to provide water for the colony, the machines must drill to the underground resources and then prepare a mechanism that will pump the water to tanks on the surface. These tanks are susceptible to low temperature. Cold can also increase the need for electricity of the colony \u00e2\u0080\u0093 this might be very troublesome if there is a sandstorm at the same time and it covers the solar cells with dust.\nA well designed and functional colony might become a home for dozens or even hundreds of citizens, each of whom has individual traits (like high ambition or being a workaholic) and four parameters: physical state, mental health, morale and general comfort. Physical state of the colonist depends on his environment: lack of oxygen or water has negative impact on his health. Frequent stress or lack of safety has negative impact on the mental state of a citizen \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it can lead to a mental breakdown. Morale determines the eagerness of a colonist to work for the greater good \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the lower it is, the greater the chance that he will perform a crime.\nThe last parameter, comfort level, represents the happiness of a colonist. The inhabitants that are happy are eager to have children. The first birth on Mars is not only an important event in colony\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history, but a possibility to make the colony independent from Earth transports as well. It is important since some events might make it impossible to call for new colonists \u00e2\u0080\u0093 for example, a bankruptcy of the sponsor or a world war that will decimate Earth.\nSurviving Mars for PC, PS4 and XONE is a sandbox, but it also offers mysteries \u00e2\u0080\u0093 optional scenarios and events that add classic science fiction tropes to the rather realistic game world. For example, such task might start with a sudden appearance of UFOs near the colony. Examining the mysteries is risky: it can either provide profits or lead to a disaster.Technical aspectsThe graphics of the game are inspired by retrofuturism. The machines used by the player during the colonization combine traits of modern technology with unique style that was present in the expectations of futurologists during the sixties. For example, the colonists are living in giant glass domes that look like a cut out piece of Earth ecosystem \u00e2\u0080\u0093 they have green glass, trees, houses and streets.\nSurviving Mars for PC, PS4 and XONE supports mods.

In order to reach that goal you have to explore his manor in search of needed items. However, the protagonist struggles with mental problems, turning exploration into chaotic travel through the artist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s troubled mind, during which you learn of his past and the history of his family.

Bloober Team further enriched gameplay with logic puzzles and short action sequences.\nIn the game you can use various objects (grand piano, chains, levers, buttons), open cabinets, drawers, or doors, and read notes left here and there. You cannot use a weapon or any other self-defense tools, and the game features no HUD bars (like a sanity bar), although confronting visions haunting the hero may lead to his \u00e2\u0080\u009cdeath\u00e2\u0080\u009d.

The hero goes together with two partners to a bleak town to investigate a crime scene at the local psychiatric facility built in the Gothic style. It turns out that the place where the murder was committed is completely empty. After crossing the gate of the hospital, the detectives are witnessing frightening view of brutally massacred bodies.

The atmosphere is not turned up by strong storyline turbulences, but slow discovery of the mysteries of the scary town.\nIn The Evil Within for PC, PS4 and etc. the action is mainly linear, and locations that we visit during this dark journey are claustrophobic.

An additional complication is the impact of the bloodcurdling events on the psyche of the protagonist, inspired by another game published under the aegis of Bethesda Softworks, Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth. This element causes, inter alia, lesser mobility of Sebastian and changes the appearance of animations.\nThe game is powered by the modified id Tech 5 engine which was originally used in the production of Rage by id Software. Dark graphics, greatly detailted meticulous monsters, and diverse environment raising the adrenaline level, respectively, are the strength of the production. The creators at all costs tried to create unique models of zombies and other monster in the game.

They speak in turns, until the winner is drawn, who makes the final decision in a given situation. Full cooperation is advisable during fights because many skills (especially magical ones) can be combined into powerful combinations, which greatly increases our chance of victory.

Just like Statis, studio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s previous production, Beautiful Desolation was funded on Kickstarter.PlotThe story in Beautiful Desolation for PC begins in 1980 when a mysterious monolith appeared in the sky. The mysterious Alien construction (named Penrose by the people) was thoroughly investigated and researched by scientists, and all the gathered technology was reverse-engineered. Thanks to that, the mankind made a colossal civilization leap. Initially, the nations of the Earth were united by the amazing discovery, but it was only a matter of time before old feuds reemerged \u00e2\u0080\u0093 this lead to a global conflict.Many years have passed since that time.

The game\u00e2\u0080\u0099s world, created in cooperation with Brian Fargo, is an original blend of half-desert areas and post-apocalytic town and settlements. This Africa is inhabited not only by groups that use the Penrose technology, but also by local tribes whose culture is based on rituals and customs characteristic for aboriginal Africans. As we play, we will encounter all kinds of mutated fauna. Some of them will be friendly; some of them will simply try to kill us. Despite that, the game has no combat mechanics.\nSolving riddles also plays an important role in the game. Most of them are based on using and tampering with the gathered items. Their difficulty level may vary, forcing players to look for clues. We can find them by talking with NPCs or closely observing the environment. Like in many other adventure games, we will be frequently using our inventory.

During combat he uses firearms (ranging from handguns to bazookas), homemade explosives, and melee techniques. The cover system helps him to stay alive, as well.", "Expected_Rating": "8.5", "Current_Rating": "7.405"}, {"Title": "Overcooked 2", "Tags": ["Arcade", "Isometric view", "humorous", "for 2 people", "about cooking", "co-op", "splitscreen"], "Developer": "Ghost Town Games", "Publisher": "Team17", "Mode": "single / multiplayer", "Release_Date_Day": "07", "Release_Date_Month": "August", "Release_Date_Year": "2018", "Game_Description": "Overcooked 2 is a\u00a0sequel to an unusual cooperation game created by Ghost Town Games and released in 2016 by Team17.PlotThe second entry in the Overcooked series is set in the same Onion Kingdom we know from the first game, as we saved it from the imminent destruction. This time we have to face a\u00a0new threat in form of the undead bread army called Unbread, which appeared due to Onion King\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unfortunate reading of the mystical book of Necronomnomicon. Our only hope is to once more put a\u00a0chef\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hat on and prepare for a\u00a0confrontation against bread horde by overcoming a\u00a0series of cooking challenges.Game mechanicsOvercooked 2 doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t try to reinvent the formula of the original game. We are taken to various kitchens (presented from an isometric view) and try to prepare dishes for awaiting clients. The key part is to strictly follow recipes, delivering and preparing required ingredients in a\u00a0correct order. The game is very fast-paced and requires fast and precise actions to deliver well-prepared dishes before a\u00a0patience of our guests runs off.That doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean there are no changes in the second Overcooked that bring more variety to the game. Players can throw held ingredients to other chefs or straight to a\u00a0pan or a\u00a0pot (or on a\u00a0floor if that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what we want). Kitchens themselves are even more varied (new additions include a\u00a0magic school, a\u00a0balloon and even another planet) and some of them change with time, providing a\u00a0greater challenge. There is also no shortage of new recipes, chefs, and equipment, as well as an interactive map of the world.Game modesLike its predecessor, Overcooked 2 offers a\u00a0single-player campaign and a\u00a0local multiplayer, in which up to four players can cooperate or rival in various challenges. Additionally, the game adds online multiplayer mode.Technical aspectsAs in gameplay, Overcooked 2 doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t revolutionize visuals. The title offers a\u00a0simple, but humoristic three-dimensional visuals which charm with their cartoonish style.", "Expected_Rating": "10", "Current_Rating": "7.8"}]
