This is the debut project of a Korean studio, Pearl Abyss. The studio, although new, employs industry veterans only. First of all, thelead designer of the game is Dae-Il Kim, who served the same role in the production of RYL Online and Continent of the Ninth.The action takes place in a grim fantasy world ravaged by unrelenting conflict. The game starts with creating your own character, choosing between several diverse races and classes. The heart of the game is an extensive system of combat. The mechanics of fighting are heavily arcade, and depend on reflexes of the players, rather than the statistics of their characters. We need to aim every blow and arrow, and perform every dodge. In combat, we use, among others, swords, spears, axes, bows, crossbows, and spells. We can also fight on horseback and other kinds of mounts. What is more, we can combine attacks into combos, which will increase the damage dealt further.Black Desert offers one big virtual world on each server, devoid of instantiating. PvP plays an important role in the game. Sieges of fortresses are especially interesting in which we use, among others, mobile towers, ladders, cannons and catapults. The authors also made sure that an extensive virtual economy system is present. The players can collect materials, trade, cultivate the fields, build factories, hire NPCs, craft items, and purchase and manage estates.

Contrary to the previous games in the series, the title lacks a singleplayer campaign. Instead, the developers decided to tell the story of various Specialists through the multiplayer mode.MechanicsThe action in Call of Duty: Black Ops IIII is presented from a first-person perspective. The game introduces various changes to the gameplay mechanics. The most important one is the lack of automatic health regeneration. Now the players can heal themselves manually when the time is right. The developers also removed the wall running and thrust jumps. The weapons are never pulled down and it is possible to shoot even while climbing or using the grappling hook.In multiplayer mode, the players assume the role of specialists. Each of them features a unique set of combat skills, advantages, and weaknesses. Taking advantage of these differences is the key to victory.

It focuses not on individual battles, but on team-based play. The game also introduces a battle royale module called Blackout. In Blackout, the players are taken to a vast map (about 1500 times larger than the famous Nuketown) that features things taken from the most popular maps in the series. The map can be traveled through on foot or by using vehicles and machines (including boats, planes, and cars). The players assume the role of classic characters from previous entries in the series and in order to win one player must become the last man standing.\nBlack Ops IIII also features a Zombie mode that starts a new story. During the game in this mode, the players assume control of nine characters that face ancient, evil order. It is worth mentioning that the zombies can be fought together with other players or with companions controlled by artificial intelligence.Technical aspectsCall of Duty: Black Ops IIII is powered by an improved version of the engine that was used in previous games in the series.

However, the game features characters familiar to fans of the series, such as Mason, Woods, and Hudson, and joined by a previously unknown CIA agent, Russel Adler.As the title suggests, the game is set during the Cold War and we have to thwart the plans of an enigmatic KGB agent, known by the code name Perseus.  Interestingly, the game has several endings - which one we see depends on the decisions we make during the final stages.GameplayIn Black Ops Cold War we observe the action from a first-person perspective (FPP).  Interestingly, for the first time in the series we create our own character - the hero we will play as.  We don't have the possibility to decide on the appearance, but we can choose the gender, the course of previous service and perks making the game easier. The single-player mode consists of missions that take us to various corners of the world, such as a giant Soviet training facility, as well as cities such as Moscow and Berlin. The tasks we face are varied - although there are some that require us to take part in bloody and spectacular shootouts, we often have to work quietly, sneaking behind enemy lines.  What's interesting, from time to time the developers also let us decide how to solve the problems that stand in our way. In addition, at certain moments we can make choices that affect the subsequent course of the plot and its conclusion.Cross-play multiplayerApart from the story mode, CoD Cold War features an extensive multiplayer mode allowing for cross-platform gameplay.

To prevent a similar situations from ever happening, the world has decided to create a special defense system. Unfortunately, nobody prepared for the other dangers that could lead humanity to the brink of chaos. Climate changes, shrinking resources, and an ideological conflict regarding genetic modifications and implants had divided the society and became a reason for increasingly bloodier wars.The situation slowly begins to spiral out of control, as some previously undisclosed military projects come to light, and we also need to keep in mind the increasing consciousness of machines, which complicates everything. Nevertheless, even the technologies available to the army are nothing compared to the so-called NDI, which is a gigantic mental network to which all members of the Black Ops special forces are connected. It allows the commandos to accomplish even the most difficult of tasks and provides them with a virtually superhuman coordination.\nAt the beginning of Call of Duty: Black Ops III, one of the teams is sent on a mission only to suddenly abandon it for no obvious reasons.

An interesting option was also provided in the form of playing together on one screen. Unlike the previous parts of the series, the story campaign in Black Ops III has a more open map structure, and the missions begin in a special lobby. In the so-called bunker players can prepare for the assignment, select equipment, spend points on skills or read previously acquired notes.\nConsiderable changes have also been implemented in the multiplayer mode. Players were given the opportunity to take control of one of nine specialists, each with their own unique weapons and an additional special skill. Equally important is the additional option of running up walls and shooting underwater, thanks to which the maps, despite their small size, gain some additional depth. The gameplay is very dynamic, and the several extra moves that can be performed, thanks to the engines mounted on the soldier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s back, add to the game's fast and chaotic pace.

The game also offers the possibility to modify the appearance of the heroes thanks to cosmetic items, which can be obtained as rewards or bought with special credits.We always start the action in Destruction AllStars moving on our own, but we can do much more by driving one of the dozens of available vehicles.  We can choose between standard machines, which appear in the arena, and the option to summon a special vehicle for a given hero.  Machines differ in performance, maneuverability and durability.  In the moment of destroying the driven car we can die or survive and set off to find another vehicle.  There is also an option to jump to another car and throw the driver out of it in order to get behind the wheel yourself - it's based on a simple mini-game. \nFights take place on large arenas, where we regularly clash with our rivals and try to complete objectives set by the match - these may include collecting points or finding objects.  Special abilities activated by characters and their vehicles can have a significant influence on the course of a match.

The game was created and is being developed by the Japanese company Square Enix.  It is worth noting that A Realm Reborn is the second version of Final Fantasy XIV, prepared after the failure of the original release from 2010.  The developers put a lot of work into polishing the game and changed many of its concepts. In Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn we play as heroes who set off to rescue the continent of Eorzea, located in the world of Hydaelyn.  The land is recovering from a gigantic catastrophe caused by the summoning of Bahamut, an ancient being of great power. Eorzea has survived the cataclysm, but faces new problems - growing local conflicts and the threat of the Garlean Empire and other, more mysterious factions.  The power within the player characters will help to deal with these problems.  \nFinal Fantasy XIV is a typical MMORPG where players create characters and travel through a world filled with monsters, quests and items.  The game contains some interesting ideas, including dynamic Fate events, repetitive \"levequests\", or even a system of three large firms, within which you can advance to higher ranks. There were also group dungeons, instances and PvP modes.  In addition, players can become owners of their own headquarters, mount (Chocobo) or even a companion, who can be commissioned to sell items. \nWhen creating a hero, you can choose the gender and race.  The land of Eorzea is inhabited by the human Hyur, the elf-like Elezen, the small-sized Lalafell, the tall Roegadyn and the animal-like Miqo'te.  Each of the races has certain characteristics, although the abilities of a hero are determined mainly by the class - \"war\" (Gladiator, Pugilist, Marauder, Lancer, Archer) or \"magic\". (Conjurer, Thaumaturge, Arcanist).  Players can change classes freely and develop them simultaneously. This way, an Archer, for example, can use some of Conjurer's attacks or spells.

A huge spaceship called Flores is sent to the planet, where the eponymous Outriders, perfectly trained soldiers, have to deal with potential threats of the new world. Although initially, the planet Enoch seemed an exceptionally hospitable place, the colonizers picked up a strange signal after some time; when they tried to reach its source, a powerful Anomaly was triggered. The cataclysm killed many settlers and severely injured others, while destroying nearly all the technology taken from Earth. Among the survivors was the protagonist, whom we play as during the game.

These include, among others, a pyromancer, who sets fire to everything that comes his way, a nimble trickster who can manipulate time, and a heavy-armed devastator who feels best on the front line.

There, we can talk to the settlers and accept tasks from them (both pushing forward the plot and side quests), as well as learn more about the presented world.\nThe foundation of the game is completing the missions and fighting with hordes of enemies, on our way there will monsters of all sorts and hostile people. Clashes are dynamic and although the game implements a system of cover, aggressive behavior is often more rewarding. One of the things that encourages you to be more offensive it is the system of regenerating life points \u00e2\u0080\u0093 while a small part of them can be restored by avoiding enemy fire, more can be regained in other ways, determined by your character's profession; for example, a pyromancer heals as setting fire to enemies, while a devastator heals as they manage to kill an enemy in melee combat. During battles we use an extensive arsenal of firearms and a wide range of combat skills. For example, the trickster can teleport across the battlefield and create \"bubbles\" that slow down opponents, while the pyromancer creates a devastating wall of fire.\nThe character development system is also included. During the gameplay we receive experience points and gain further levels. Every few promotions, we unlock new abilities, but although each class has eight of them, only three can be active at the same time. However, we receive so-called class points on subsequent levels, which we can spend on special modifications that provide us with additional buffs in the form of bonuses to hero stats or specific skills. We also increase our combat potential by collecting better equipment and by modifying our weapons and armor elements.\nOutriders runs on Unreal Engine 4 technology.

The combat system is arcade and very dynamic, but at the same time has a tactical layer - the right sense of rhythm is important here; by striking at the right pace, we can stun large groups of enemies.A number of mechanics known from the main installments of the Persona series return - for example, we can develop our personas (these are peculiar \"ghosts\" accompanying the heroes and responsible for their unusual abilities) by spending special points, gain new ones (by picking up masks left over from some defeated enemies), and even combine them to create more powerful variants. The game also features skill cards, which allow you to give a specific ability to a particular persona. \nWe have the opportunity to control not only the Joker (who, like in Persona 5, has a unique ability to change personas during the fight), but also many other characters - mainly members of the  Phantom Thieves of Hearts team. The game allows to freely switch between characters during the game - we can choose any persona except  navigator.\nAs in Persona 5, strengthening the relationships between characters is also important.  By defeating enemies and reaching specific points in the story, we receive points called Band, which we can invest in stats.  Our heroes also learn during combat, with time unlocking special abilities - the  Master Arts. The longer we play a hero, the more options we get. Additionally, it is possible to buy equipment, which allows to increase effectiveness in battles. Game modes\n In Persona 5 Scramble: The Phantom Strikers we can only play alone.  The core of the game is a feature campaign.Technical aspects\nPersona 5 Scramble: The Phantom Strikers offers a good, 3D graphic design, which is similar in style to Persona 5. Both the characters and locations look like they have been taken out of an anime, and the animations during fights look very spectacular - the lighting effects accompanying the characters' special abilities deserve special attention.  The soundtrack is also similar - there is even an option to download tracks from the original game as DLC.", "Expected_Rating": "7.7", "Current_Rating": "6"}, {"Title": "Rise of the Tomb Raider: 20 Year Celebration", "Tags": ["Action", "TPP", "TPS", "crafting", "action adventure"], "Developer": "Nixxes Software", "Publisher": "Square-Enix / Eidos", "Mode": "single player", "Release_Date_Day": "11", "Release_Date_Month": "October", "Release_Date_Year": "2016", "Game_Description": "The Tomb Raider series is one of the most recognizable franchises in the gaming industry. After a few excellent installments and a small crisis, the series came to be loved again by its fans in 2013 with the release of the splendid reboot called simply Tomb Raider. The title sold over 8 million copies worldwide, so Square Enix instructed Crystal Dynamics (the creators of the series as well as Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver) to produce another game. It turned out to be Rise of the Tomb Raider for PS4. The production was initially released for Xbox (360/One) in November, 2015, then PC at the beginning of 2016, and after a year it finally came out for the Sony console. The release date is practically the only difference between the versions for all platforms (aside from significantly better graphics than those offered by Xbox 360).\nStory\nRise of the Tomb Raider for PS4 continues the story of its predecessor. The events that took place on the island of Yamatai left their mark on the protagonist, making her a tougher, more ruthless and restless woman. This time around, Lara decided to follow the trail of a mysterious Prophet to Siberia, and her objective are the ruins of the city of Kitezh, that allegedly hides the secret of immortality. The plot is connected to the research conducted by the heroine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father, and his suicide, as well as the Order of Trinity, the eternal enemies of the Prophet and his people.\nGameplay\nAs far as gameplay mechanics are concerned, in Rise of the Tomb Raider for PS4, the developers stayed true to the solutions of the previous installments of the series. Sneaking behind enemies' backs and using such tools as a bow are still of significant importance, although the game does not lack fierce shootouts. Importantly, the locations became, more or less, three times bigger, thanks to which we will spend more time on exploration and searching for various items or crafting materials. The developers expanded on the crafting system by adding the possibility of creating a large variety of useful items (such as bandages, Molotov cocktails, poisoned arrows, and so on) as well as more complex equipment enhancing methods.\nGame modes\nRise of the Tomb Raider is meant primarily for solo play. Completionist campaign playthrough can take up to 40 hours, but the developers prepared other modes, as well; these include Endurance; Horde; as well as:\nScore Attack \u00e2\u0080\u0093 beating individual levels as fast as possible, tackling the changed rules of play.\nRemnant Resistance \u00e2\u0080\u0093 creating your own scenarios with the possibility of setting some of the gameplay elements like mission objectives, enemies, and such (these can be edited with the use of Expedition Cards which are a special gameplay modifiers).

You play as one of the last Dovahkiin, dragon hunters. Until recently, it was thought that the powerful beasts were long since extinct, but one day they appear in the skies again, and a prophecy foretells the coming of Alduin, the god of destruction, who takes on the form of a dragon. When fighting dragons, you absorb their souls and abilities, the so-called Shouts. Thanks to them, you can slow time, push back your foes with the use of an invisible energy, and even call an allied dragon to help you. Many such abilities are unlocked by finding ancient words located in Nordic underground ruins.MechanicsYou start the game of The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim Special Edition for PC, PS4 and etc. by creating your character. You can choose from ten varied races, and there are no specific classes. As the game progresses, your character grows more powerful. Every time you level up, you choose which of the three basic stats \u00e2\u0080\u0093 magicka, stamina and health \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you want to increase. The skill system has been completely overhauled: the skills are now divided into distinct groups, such as one-handed or two-handed weapons. Every group consists of particular abilities and attacks. The magic system has also been changes\u00e2\u0080\u0094the Mysticism school spells have been moved to other skill groups.Skyrim features a new, more dynamic combat system, which demands tactical thinking. Both hands of your character can now use weapons, shields, or spells. It enables you to create many combinations, e.g. combining an attack spell in one hand with a sword in the other. Direct combat can no longer by won by mindlessly mashing your keyboard\u00e2\u0080\u0094now you have to manoeuvre your character properly, dodge and parry blows, and stagger your enemies. You can also be easily staggered yourself, which makes you vulnerable to the attacks of your foes, who are now more dangerous and durable. Your character can also perform spectacular finishing moves.\nThe fifth instalment of The Elder Scrolls series once again wants you to feel as if you are traversing a real world, populated with real people. The consequences of your decisions are now more serious and linked to the more interesting behaviour of other characters. For example, if you drop a dagger in the middle of a city, someone may either return it to you or steal it. The dialogues have also been improved and now they feel much more natural. When you get bored of saving the world, you may take a break to do some more mundane tasks. The game allows you to gather crops, smith weapons in forges, cook, mine ores in mines, and even make armours.\nThe Elder Scrolls: Skyrim Special Edition allows you to traverse an enormous virtual world, in which you can visit e.g. five major cities and hundreds of dungeons.

It was supposed to be another installment in the famous series of tactical shooters, this time focusing on combat with a terrorist organization called True Patriots. Since then, years had passed, and the project slowly faded away. Finally, the publisher decided to unveil Rainbow Six: Siege, tailor-made for multiplayer gameplay. This title replaced Patriots, which failed to meet the expectations of the French company. This PC, PS4 and XONE game features skirmishes of antiterrorist special forces with criminals. The game was built on AnvilNext technology, the engine used in several other Ubisoft titles, including the Assassin's Creed series, For Honor, and Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands.Before you start playing Rainbow Six: Siege you choose your soldier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s specialization.

In order to do this, you often have to blow up a wall, plant explosives on the floor to attack enemies from above, and so on.

As a result, battlefields are dynamically changing in the course of a skirmish, which often requires adjusting your well-planned tactics on the spot.\nIn terms of graphics quality Rainbow Six: Siege for PC, PS4 and XONE doesn't set new standards in video gaming, but it is surely satisfying.

However, this is not a direct sequel, as the title tells a separate story.\nAs we play, we find ourselves on a fictional Pacific island of Aurora to investigate the mysterious loss of contact.

The devs provide us with an open world, in which we can move around on foot or by using a seleciton of roughly thirty different vehicles. What distinguishes this title from the previous parts of the series is that if we decide to play alone, the main character is no longer accompanied by AI-controlled commandoes.\nA number of missions await completion to push the plot forward; however, in order to make progress, we must carefully look around Aurora and obtain intelligence (mainly through conversations with NPCs, interrogating enemies and collecting intelligence materials). In addition, we can deal with various tasks and side activities.\nAlthough the combat plays an important role here (we can unlock new weapons, i.e. rocket launchers, complemented by numerous gadgets, such as a burner, enabling us to cut holes in fences), the devs decided to deepen the gameplay, implementing new survival mechanics. For example, a system of wounds and injuries has been introduced, which affects the combat potential of our hero; when shot in the knee, they start to limp, blinded - suffer from sight disorders, while if their chest is damaged, they will cough up blood. All these inconveniences can be cured by various means.\nIn addition, there is nothing to prevent us from using weapons taken from defeated adversaries or hiding their bodies. An important novelty is also the possibility of using natural camouflage; the protagonist may cover themselves with mud to blend in with the environment and set up an ambush for the enemies.

The game was developed by the Chicago division of Wargaming.net, the creators of Order of War and the Massive Assault series. The initial version of the game was released in the spring of 2011 for PC, but since the production proved to be incredibly successful, it was eventually converted to 7th- and 8th-generation platforms as well. Later on, World of Tanks Blitz, a somewhat simplified mobile edition of the title, and World of Tanks Generals, a strategy card game, were released.\nGameplay\nThe essence of World of Tanks for PC, PS4 and etc. is competitive multiplayer gameplay in short mini-campaigns and tournaments as well as single battles fought in one of several game modes. The action is shown from third-person perspective, featuring simulation complemented with action, strategy, and RPG elements. The production offers more than 300 different tanks and armored vehicles (roughly 150 were present in the initial release) from various historical periods to choose from; from the World War I to Cold War era. The vehicles come from different countries (the USA, the Soviet Union, Germany, France, Great Britain, Japan, and China) and are divided into five main classes: light, medium, and heavy tanks, tank destroyers, and self-propelled guns. Moreover, each of those is assigned to one of ten tiers that determines their advancement level.Starting out, we are given tier 1 vehicles only. We unlock access to the remaining ones, divided further into country-specific technology trees, as we progress and gather experience. Furthermore, we may buy a number of enhancements, such as engines, turrets, chassis, guns or radio systems, for the credits we earn playing. What is interesting, all of them have their historical justification \u00e2\u0080\u0094 either their prototypes existed or they were actually introduced into service at some point. We might also purchase a myriad of useful gadgets, including camouflage, modern targeting systems, repair kits or first aid kits, with which we can treat wounded crew members. It is also worth of mention that the personnel also gains experience, which translates into improved performance on the battlefield.\nGame modes\nThe production of Wargaming.net offers an incredibly wide range of game modes, which is constantly broadened with subsequent updates. Among the most important ones we can find the random battle, squad battle, clan war, company, assault or the stronghold mode. Two 15-member teams (PlayStation 4 has this number increased to 30), which can be additionally divided into 2- or 3-member platoons, may participate in a single battle. As befits a proper MMO title, World of Tanks does not lack the possibility of joining or creating a clan (with a maximum of 100 members) and competing with other clans for control over areas on the world map.\nTechnology\nWorld of Tanks for PC, PS4 and etc. is powered by the BigWorld Technology engine modified for the purposes of the game. Thanks to the high quality visuals and simulation-focused gameplay, we may feel like a real tank commander. The destruction model is especially noteworthy. It takes into account such factors as the shell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hit angle, armor thickness and the like, and the calculations of the shell's chance to penetrate individual modules and damage taken by the crew is depicted with percentages.\nAdditional information\nWorld of Tanks was awarded a number of industry awards, including the most innovative game at E3 2010 as well as the Golden Joystick Award for the best MMO of 2012. Moreover, the game was recorded in the Guinness World Records for the largest amount of players logged in at the same time on a single MMO game server. On January 21st 2013, 190.541 players were playing simultaneously on a Russian server.", "Expected_Rating": "8.7", "Current_Rating": "3.3"}]
